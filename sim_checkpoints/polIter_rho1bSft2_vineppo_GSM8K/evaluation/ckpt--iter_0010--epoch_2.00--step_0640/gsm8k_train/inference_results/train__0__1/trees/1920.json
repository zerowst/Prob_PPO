He walked 20 feet to the end of the road, then doubled that distance to get to the next intersection, so he walked 2*20 = 40 feet before the left turn.\nNow we need to find how far he walked after the left turn. He walked 40 feet to get to the end of his route, then doubled that distance to get to the next intersection, so he walked 2*40 = 80 feet after the left turn.\nNow we need to find how far he walked before the right turn. He walked 80 feet to get to the end of his route, then half that distance to get to the end of his route, so he walked 80/2 = 40 feet before the right turn.\nNow we need to find how far he walked after the right turn. He walked 40 feet to get to the end of his route, then half that distance to get to the end of his route, so he walked 40/2 = 20 feet after the right turn.\nNow we need to find the total distance he walked. We know he walked 20 feet before the left turn, 40 feet before the right turn, 80 feet after the left turn, and 40 feet after the right turn, so the total distance he walked is 20+40+80+20 = 180 feet.\n#### 180\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, we need to find the total distance Rich walked to the end of the road: 200 feet + 20 feet = 220 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance he walked to the next intersection: 220 feet * 2 = 440 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the intersection to the end of his route: 440 feet / 2 = 220 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the starting point: 220 feet * 2 = 440 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the starting point back to his house: 440 feet * 2 = 880 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the starting point to the end of his route: 880 feet + 220 feet = 1,000 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the starting point: 1,000 feet * 2 = 2,000 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the starting point to the end of his route: 2,000 feet + 220 feet = 2,220 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the starting point back to the house: 2,220 feet * 2 = 4,440 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the starting point to the end of his route: 4,440 feet + 220 feet = 4,660 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 4,660 feet * 2 = 9,320 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 9,320 feet + 20 feet = 9,340 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 9,340 feet * 2 = 18,680 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 18,680 feet + 20 feet = 18,660 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 18,660 feet * 2 = 37,320 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 37,320 feet + 20 feet = 37,340 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 37,340 feet * 2 = 74,680 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 74,680 feet + 20 feet = 74,700 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 74,700 feet * 2 = 149,400 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 149,400 feet + 20 feet = 149,420 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 149,420 feet * 2 = 298,840 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 298,840 feet + 20 feet = 298,860 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 298,860 feet * 2 = 597,720 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 597,720 feet + 20 feet = 597,740 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the end of his route back to the house: 597,740 feet * 2 = 1195,480 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the house to the end of his route: 1195,480 feet + 20 feet = 1195,482 feet.\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRich likes to take long walks through town.  First he walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.  Then he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.  Then he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far until he reaches the next intersection.  Then he walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route, before turning around and walking the same path all the way back home.  How many feet did Rich walk?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to find the total distance Rich walked to the end of the road: 200 feet + 20 feet = 220 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance he walked to the next intersection: 220 feet * 2 = 440 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the intersection to the end of his route: 440 feet / 2 = 220 feet.\nThen we need to find the distance from the
