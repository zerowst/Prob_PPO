Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan.  Susan ran second and she took 10 seconds longer than Jen.  Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\n\nSolution:\nMary ran the first leg and it took 2 * Susan's time = 2 * (Susan's time + 10 seconds) = 2 * (Jen's time + 10 seconds) = 2 * (30 seconds + 10 seconds) = 120 seconds.\nSusan ran the second leg and it took 10 seconds longer than Jen's time = 10 seconds + Jen's time = 10 seconds + 30 seconds = 40 seconds.\nTiffany ran the last leg and it took 7 seconds less than Mary's time = Mary's time - 7 seconds.\nMary's time = 120 seconds + 40 seconds + 7 seconds = 167 seconds.\nThe team took 167 seconds + 120 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds = 337 seconds to finish the race.\n#### 337\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.719357028603554, "len_probs": 220, "answer": "\nMary ran the first leg and it took 2 * Susan's time = 2 * (Susan's time + 10 seconds) = 2 * (Jen's time + 10 seconds) = 2 * (30 seconds + 10 seconds) = 120 seconds.\nSusan ran the second leg and it took 10 seconds longer than Jen's time = 10 seconds + Jen's time = 10 seconds + 30 seconds = 40 seconds.\nTiffany ran the last leg and it took 7 seconds less than Mary's time = Mary's time - 7 seconds.\nMary's time = 120 seconds + 40 seconds + 7 seconds = 167 seconds.\nThe team took 167 seconds + 120 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds = 337 seconds to finish the race.\n#### 337\n"}]}
