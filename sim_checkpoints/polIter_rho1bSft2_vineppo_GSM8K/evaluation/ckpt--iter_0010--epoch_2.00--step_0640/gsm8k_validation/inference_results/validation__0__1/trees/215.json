In addition, Elmer has a son named Melvin, who loves to catch pollywogs, remove them from the pond, and release them into a nearby stream.  For the first 20 days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream.  How many days did it take for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond?\n\nSolution:\nFor the first 20 days, Melvin caught and released 10 pollywogs per day, for a total of 10*20=200 pollywogs.\nThese 200 pollywogs represent 200/50=4 days of constant maturation.\nIn the first 4 days, the pollywogs were leaving the pond at a rate of 2400/4=600 pollywogs per day.\nTo replace the 200 pollywogs that Elmer released, the pond needed to have 2400-200=2200 pollywogs.\nThis means that the pond needed to have 2200/600=3.67 days to replace the pollywogs that were leaving.\nSince Elmer initially had 2400 pollywogs, this means that 2400-200=2200 pollywogs had to disappear.\nThus, it took 2200/50=44 days for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\n#### 44\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.11950585618615, "len_probs": 270, "answer": "\nFor the first 20 days, Melvin caught and released 10 pollywogs per day, for a total of 10*20=200 pollywogs.\nThese 200 pollywogs represent 200/50=4 days of constant maturation.\nIn the first 4 days, the pollywogs were leaving the pond at a rate of 2400/4=600 pollywogs per day.\nTo replace the 200 pollywogs that Elmer released, the pond needed to have 2400-200=2200 pollywogs.\nThis means that the pond needed to have 2200/600=3.67 days to replace the pollywogs that were leaving.\nSince Elmer initially had 2400 pollywogs, this means that 2400-200=2200 pollywogs had to disappear.\nThus, it took 2200/50=44 days for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\n#### 44\n"}]}
