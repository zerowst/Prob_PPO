A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe school paid $100 * 2 = $200 for the kindergarten library models.\nThe school paid $100 * 4 = $400 for the elementary library models.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten and elementary library models was $200 + $400 = $600.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nSo the school paid $100 * 0.95 = $95 for each kindergarten library model.\nAnd it paid $100 * 0.95 = $95 for each elementary library model.\nThe school paid $95 * 2 = $190 for the kindergarten library models.\nAnd it paid $95 * 4 = $380 for the elementary library models.\nIn total, the school paid $190 + $380 = $570 for all the models.\n#### 570\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.51667733490467, "len_probs": 285, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe school paid $100 * 2 = $200 for the kindergarten library models.\nThe school paid $100 * 4 = $400 for the elementary library models.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten and elementary library models was $200 + $400 = $600.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nSo the school paid $100 * 0.95 = $95 for each kindergarten library model.\nAnd it paid $100 * 0.95 = $95 for each elementary library model.\nThe school paid $95 * 2 = $190 for the kindergarten library models.\nAnd it paid $95 * 4 = $380 for the elementary library models.\nIn total, the school paid $190 + $380 = $570 for all the models.\n#### 570\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought 2 x 2 = 4 dinosaur models for the elementary library.\nSo, the school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe original price of each dinosaur model is $100.\nSo, the total cost for the 6 dinosaur models is $100 x 6 = $600.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nTherefore, the school paid $100 x 5/100 = $5 less for each model.\nHence, the price for each model is $100 - $5 = $95.\nThus, the school paid $95 x 6 = $570 in all.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
