How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine and each quarter is worth $0.25 so each machine holds 80*$0.25 = $20.00\nThere are 100 dimes in a machine and each dime is worth $0.10 so each machine holds 100*$0.10 = $10.00\nIf she holds $20.00 in quarters and $10.00 in dimes then she holds $20+$10 = $30.00 in each machine\nShe holds $30.00 in each machine and there are 2 types of machines so she holds 30*2 = $60.00 in total\nShe cashes in $90.00 and each machine holds $60.00 so she must have 90/$60 = 1.5 machines\n#### 1.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.245559953153133, "len_probs": 208, "answer": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine and each quarter is worth $0.25 so each machine holds 80*$0.25 = $20.00\nThere are 100 dimes in a machine and each dime is worth $0.10 so each machine holds 100*$0.10 = $10.00\nIf she holds $20.00 in quarters and $10.00 in dimes then she holds $20+$10 = $30.00 in each machine\nShe holds $30.00 in each machine and there are 2 types of machines so she holds 30*2 = $60.00 in total\nShe cashes in $90.00 and each machine holds $60.00 so she must have 90/$60 = 1.5 machines\n#### 1.5\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so each machine is worth 80 * $0.25 = $20.\nThere are 100 dimes in a machine, and each dime is worth $0.10, so each machine is worth 100 * $0.10 = $10.\nEach machine is worth $20 + $10 = $30.\nErin collected $30 from each machine, so she had $30 * 10 = $300 from all the machines.\nThis means there were 90 / $30 = 3 machines in the launderette.\n#### 3\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
