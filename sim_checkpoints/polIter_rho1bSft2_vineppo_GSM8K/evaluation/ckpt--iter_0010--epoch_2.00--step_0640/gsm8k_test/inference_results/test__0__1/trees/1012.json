What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the total capacity of the battery.\nAfter 5 hours, the battery had charged to 0.95x.\nAfter 6 hours, the battery had charged to 0.95x * 0.07 = 0.063x.\nAfter 7 hours, the battery had charged to 0.063x * 0.07 = 0.00441x.\nAfter 8 hours, the battery had charged to 0.00441x * 0.09 = 0.0004099x.\nAfter 9 hours, the battery had charged to 0.0004099x * 0.9 = 0.0003701x.\nAfter 10 hours, the battery had charged to 0.0003701x * 0.95 = 0.000346805x.\nThe charge remaining was 0.000346805x * 0.28 = 0.000090314x = 90.314% of the battery's capacity.\nThus, the battery's capacity was 90.314% * 100 = 9031.4% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 9031.4% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery'", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -34.73790617287159, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nLet x be the total capacity of the battery.\nAfter 5 hours, the battery had charged to 0.95x.\nAfter 6 hours, the battery had charged to 0.95x * 0.07 = 0.063x.\nAfter 7 hours, the battery had charged to 0.063x * 0.07 = 0.00441x.\nAfter 8 hours, the battery had charged to 0.00441x * 0.09 = 0.0004099x.\nAfter 9 hours, the battery had charged to 0.0004099x * 0.9 = 0.0003701x.\nAfter 10 hours, the battery had charged to 0.0003701x * 0.95 = 0.000346805x.\nThe charge remaining was 0.000346805x * 0.28 = 0.000090314x = 90.314% of the battery's capacity.\nThus, the battery's capacity was 90.314% * 100 = 9031.4% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 9031.4% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery's capacity.\nThe battery's capacity was 90314% * 100 = 90314% of the battery'"}]}
