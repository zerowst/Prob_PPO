At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?\n\nSolution:\nThe jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved $6 / 2 = $3 from the jogger jeans.\nHe saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the tattered jeans.\nSo he saved a total of $3 + $2 = $5 from both jeans.\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $5 = $27.\nHence, the jogger jeans originally cost $27 - $28 = $1 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -8.960775971412659, "len_probs": 133, "answer": "\nThe jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved $6 / 2 = $3 from the jogger jeans.\nHe saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the tattered jeans.\nSo he saved a total of $3 + $2 = $5 from both jeans.\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $5 = $27.\nHence, the jogger jeans originally cost $27 - $28 = $1 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nHe saved $6 from the jogger jeans, so 1/3 * $6 = $2 was saved from the tattered jeans.\nThis means he saved a total of $6 + $2 = $8 from both jeans.\nIf he saved $8 from the tattered jeans, then the $6 saved from the jogger jeans was worth $8 - $6 = $2.\nThis means the jogger jeans originally cost $2 + $6 = $8.\nThe difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $28 = -$20.\nSince the difference is negative, the jogger jeans originally cost $20 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 20\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest.
