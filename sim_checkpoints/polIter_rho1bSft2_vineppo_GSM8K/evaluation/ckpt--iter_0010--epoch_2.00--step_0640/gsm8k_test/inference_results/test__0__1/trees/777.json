He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?\n\nSolution:\nHe has 600/3=200 movies in series.\nThat means he can buy 200/6=33 movies for $6 each.\nThat means he can buy 33-4=29 movies from the remainder.\nThose 29 movies cost 29*5=$145.\nSo the total cost is 145+10(600-200)=1650.\n#### 1650\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.32260750234127, "len_probs": 115, "answer": "\nHe has 600/3=200 movies in series.\nThat means he can buy 200/6=33 movies for $6 each.\nThat means he can buy 33-4=29 movies from the remainder.\nThose 29 movies cost 29*5=$145.\nSo the total cost is 145+10(600-200)=1650.\n#### 1650\n"}, {"text": "\nHe has 600/3=200 movies in series.\nHe can get 200/6=$33 of movies for $6 each.\nThat leaves 600-200=400 movies.\nHe can get 400/2=200 of the older movies for $5 each.\nThat leaves 400-200=200 movies he needs to buy.\nThe digital movies cost 200*10=$2000.\nSo the total cost is 2000+33*6=$2093.\n#### 2093\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.
