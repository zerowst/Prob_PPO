To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the length of Elaina's usual concert. Her final concert is twice as long, or 2*x.\nThe total runtime of her final concert is the length of the concert plus the length of the encore, or x+15.\nSo we have the equation: x+15=2*x\nSubtracting x from both sides, we have x+15-x=2*x-x\nSimplifying, we have 15=x\nSo her usual concert runs for 15 minutes.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.970228910446167, "len_probs": 125, "answer": "\nLet x be the length of Elaina's usual concert.
