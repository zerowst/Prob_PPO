The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nHe estimates 900/80% = 110 red jelly beans\nThe jar contains 540/1.1=490.9 cubic inches of jelly beans\nThat means he guessed too low because 900-490.9=409.1\n#### 409.1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.083020839840174, "len_probs": 103, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nHe estimates 900/80% = 110 red jelly beans\nThe jar contains 540/1.1=490.9 cubic inches of jelly beans\nThat means he guessed too low because 900-490.9=409.1\n#### 409.1\n"}, {"text": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nHe estimates 900/80%=11 red jelly beans\nThe jar contains 540*.15=81 cubic inches of jelly beans\nSo he guessed 81-11=60 cubic inches too many\nThat means he was 60/540=1/9 off\n#### 1\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.
