Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard, so he used 0.45*5 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nHe used 20% of the chalk, so he recycled 0.2*2.25 = 0.45 inches of chalk.\nHe started with 2.25 inches, so he had 2.25-0.45 = 1.8 inches left.\nHe uses 20% of the chalk again, so he will use another 0.2*1.8 = 0.36 inches.\nHe will have to recycle this piece 1.8/0.36 = 5 times.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.21893160045147, "len_probs": 171, "answer": "\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard, so he used 0.45*5 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nHe used 20% of the chalk, so he recycled 0.2*2.25 = 0.45 inches of chalk.\nHe started with 2.25 inches, so he had 2.25-0.45 = 1.8 inches left.\nHe uses 20% of the chalk again, so he will use another 0.2*1.8 = 0.36 inches.\nHe will have to recycle this piece 1.8/0.36 = 5 times.\n#### 5\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Monday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Monday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Monday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Tuesday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Tuesday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Tuesday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Wednesday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Wednesday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Wednesday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Thursday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Thursday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Thursday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Friday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Friday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Friday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Saturday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Saturday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Saturday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Sunday, the teacher used 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nOn Sunday, the teacher used 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk to write with.\nOn Sunday, the teacher used 5 - 1 = 4 inches of chalk that the teacher recycled.\nOn Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 4 / 0.45 = 8.89 inches of chalk left.\nOn Tuesday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 8.89 / 0.45 = 19.44 inches of chalk left.\nOn Wednesday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 19.44 / 0.45 = 44.44 inches of chalk left.\nOn Thursday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 44.44 / 0.45 = 98.89 inches of chalk left.\nOn Friday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 98.89 / 0.45 = 222.22 inches of chalk left.\nOn Saturday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 222.22 / 0.45 = 511.11 inches of chalk left.\nOn Sunday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 511.11 / 0.45 = 1144.44 inches of chalk left.\nOn Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 1144.44 / 0.45 = 2611.11 inches of chalk left.\nOn Tuesday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 2611.11 / 0.45 = 6044.44 inches of chalk left.\nOn Wednesday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he still has 6044.44 / 0.45 = 1", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students.
