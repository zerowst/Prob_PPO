He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?\n\nSolution:\nLet c be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats, and c2 be the number of cookies he eats. We know that c2 + 2 = 5, and that c2 = 5 - 2 = 3.\nTherefore, Matt has to eat 3 / 2 = 1.5 carrot sticks, which he can eat because he can't eat half a stick.\n#### 1.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -10.301441807299852, "len_probs": 98, "answer": "\nLet c be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats, and c2 be the number of cookies he eats.
