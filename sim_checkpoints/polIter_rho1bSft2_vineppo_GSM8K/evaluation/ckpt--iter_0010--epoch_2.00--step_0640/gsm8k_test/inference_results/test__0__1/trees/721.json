If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?\n\nSolution:\nDuring the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot a total of 250 * 2 = 500 times.\nDuring the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot a total of 300 * 3 = 900 times.\nDuring the 3 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot a total of 200 * 3 = 600 times.\nDuring the same 3 minutes, she tapped her right foot a total of 200 * 2 = 400 times.\nThus, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot a total of 500 + 600 = 1100 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot a total of 500 + 400 = 900 times.\nTherefore, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 1100 + 900 = 2000 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 900 + 400 = 1300 times.\nThus, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot a total of 2000 + 1300 = 3300 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot a total of 2000 + 400 = 2400 times.\nTherefore, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 3300 + 2400 = 5700 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 3300 + 2400 = 5700 times.\nThus, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 5700 + 5700 = 11400 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 5700 + 5700 = 11400 times.\nTherefore, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 11400 + 11400 = 22800 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 11400 + 5700 = 17100 times.\nThus, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 22800 + 17100 = 39900 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 22800 + 5700 = 28500 times.\nTherefore, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 39900 + 28500 = 68400 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 39900 + 5700 = 45600 times.\nThus, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 68400 + 45600 = 11400 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 68400 + 5700 = 74100 times.\nTherefore, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 11400 + 74100 = 85500 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she tapped her right foot 11400 + 5700 = 17100 times.\nThus, during the 5 minutes that she was dancing with her arms raised, she tapped her left foot 85500 + 17100 = 102600 times.\nAnd, during the same 5 minutes, she t", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason":
