A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nThe number of large jellyfish is 5/5 * X = X/5, where X is the total number of jellyfish.\nThe number of large jellyfish that change color is 1/3 * X/5 = X/15, where X is the total number of jellyfish.\nThe number of small jellyfish is X - X/5 - X/15 = 10X/15 = 2X/3.\nWhen a UV light turned on, 2X/3 * 1/5 = 2X/15 changed color.\nThis means that there are 6 + 2X/15 jellyfish that changed color.\nTherefore, there are X/5 + 6 + 2X/15 = 17 + X/5 jellyfish in the tank.\nThus, there are 5 * (17 + X/5) = 85 + 5X jellyfish in the tank.\nSince we are told that there are 6 + 2X/15 jellyfish that changed color, we have 85 + 5X = 6 + 2X/15.\nFrom this, we get 105 = 15X + 10X/3.\nMultiplying by 3 to get a common denominator, we get 315 = 45X + 10X.\nCombining like terms, we get 315 = 55X.\nDividing both sides by 55, we get X = 6.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.506739016622305, "len_probs": 360, "answer": "\nThe number of large jellyfish is 5/5 * X = X/5, where X is the total number of jellyfish.\nThe number of large jellyfish that change color is 1/3 * X/5 = X/15, where X is the total number of jellyfish.\nThe number of small jellyfish is X - X/5 - X/15 = 10X/15 = 2X/3.\nWhen a UV light turned on, 2X/3 * 1/5 = 2X/15 changed color.\nThis means that there are 6 + 2X/15 jellyfish that changed color.\nTherefore, there are X/5 + 6 + 2X/15 = 17 + X/5 jellyfish in the tank.\nThus, there are 5 * (17 + X/5) = 85 + 5X jellyfish in the tank.\nSince we are told that there are 6 + 2X/15 jellyfish that changed color, we have 85 + 5X = 6 + 2X/15.\nFrom this, we get 105 = 15X + 10X/3.\nMultiplying by 3 to get a common denominator, we get 315 = 45X + 10X.\nCombining like terms, we get 315 = 55X.\nDividing both sides by 55, we get X = 6.\n#### 6\n"}]}
