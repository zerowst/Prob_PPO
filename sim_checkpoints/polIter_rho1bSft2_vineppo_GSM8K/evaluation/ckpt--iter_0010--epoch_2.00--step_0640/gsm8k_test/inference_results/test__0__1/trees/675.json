Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?\n\nSolution:\nThere are now 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in the shelter.\nSo he needs 12 toys for the dogs + the 4 for the dogs he already had = 16 toys.\nBut there are twice as many more dogs as when he left so he needs 16 * 2 = 32 toys.\nWhen he came back he had to buy some more toys because 3 dogs were gone so he needed to buy 32 + 3 = 35 toys.\n#### 35\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.8053814843297, "len_probs": 120, "answer": "\nThere are now 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in the shelter.\nSo he needs 12 toys for the dogs + the 4 for the dogs he already had = 16 toys.\nBut there are twice as many more dogs as when he left so he needs 16 * 2 = 32 toys.\nWhen he came back he had to buy some more toys because 3 dogs were gone so he needed to buy 32 + 3 = 35 toys.\n#### 35\n"}]}
