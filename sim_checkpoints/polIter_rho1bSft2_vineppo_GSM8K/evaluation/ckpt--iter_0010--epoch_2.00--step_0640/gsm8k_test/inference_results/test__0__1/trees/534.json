In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of boys who went out for the scavenger hunt is 20/2 = 10 boys.\nThe number of shells the boys brought back is 60*10 = 600.\nIf the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, they brought a total of 600+4*60 = 960 seashells.\nIf the girls were divided into two equal groups, each group brought 960/2 = 480 seashells.\nSince each group had 20 kids, each girl had 480/20 = 24 seashells.\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.704896032810211, "len_probs": 169, "answer": "\nThe total number of boys who went out for the scavenger hunt is 20/2 = 10 boys.\nThe number of shells the boys brought back is 60*10 = 600.\nIf the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, they brought a total of 600+4*60 = 960 seashells.\nIf the girls were divided into two equal groups, each group brought 960/2 = 480 seashells.\nSince each group had 20 kids, each girl had 480/20 = 24 seashells.\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nThe boys brought back 60 seashells each, a total of 200 seashells.\nThe girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, which is 4*60 = 240 seashells.\nThe total number of seashells brought by the girls is 240+200 = 440 seashells.\nIf the number of girls was the same as the number of boys, each girl would have brought 440/20 = 22 seashells.\nIf the number of girls was 20 more, each girl would have brought 22+20 = 42 seashells.\n#### 42\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.
