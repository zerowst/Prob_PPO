The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nSolution:\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200 plus $25 per person, for a total of $25 per person.\nFor the second venue, the cost is $25 per person plus $5 for food, for a total of $30 per person.\nTo find the number of guests at which the two venues cost the same, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $p$:\n$200 + 25p = 30p + 5\n$200 = 5p\n$40 = p\nSo, for $40, Mark would have to invite 40 / 25 = 1.6 guests to the first venue, and 40 / 30 = 1.33 guests to the second venue.\nSince the second venue has a larger number of guests, Mark should invite 1.33 guests to the second venue.\n#### 1.33\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.90032508969307, "len_probs": 219, "answer": "\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200 plus $25 per person, for a total of $25 per person.\nFor the second venue, the cost is $25 per person plus $5 for food, for a total of $30 per person.\nTo find the number of guests at which the two venues cost the same, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $p$:\n$200 + 25p = 30p + 5\n$200 = 5p\n$40 = p\nSo, for $40, Mark would have to invite 40 / 25 = 1.6 guests to the first venue, and 40 / 30 = 1.33 guests to the second venue.\nSince the second venue has a larger number of guests, Mark should invite 1.33 guests to the second venue.\n#### 1.33\n"}, {"text": "\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200.\nFor the second venue, the cost is $25 per person + $5 for food = $30 per person.\nTo find out when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for the number of guests:\n$200 = $30(x)\n$200/30 = $x\n$6.67 = $x\nSince the number of guests cannot be a fraction, the number of guests must be 7 for the first venue and 8 for the second.\n#### 7\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.
