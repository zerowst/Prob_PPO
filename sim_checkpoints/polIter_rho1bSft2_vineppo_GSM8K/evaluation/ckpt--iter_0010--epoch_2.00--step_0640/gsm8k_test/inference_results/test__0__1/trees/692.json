One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne apple costs 0.5 dollars, so two apples cost 2 * 0.5 = 1 dollar.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * 0.5 = 1 dollar.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * 1 = 3 dollars.\nTherefore, a crate of fruit consists of 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 bananas,\n7 * 1 = 7 apples, and 7 * 3 = 21 oranges.\nSo the crate costs 2.5 * 2 + 7 * 1 + 21 * 3 = 5 + 7 + 63 = 75 dollars.\n#### 75\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.141165390610695, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nOne apple costs 0.5 dollars, so two apples cost 2 * 0.5 = 1 dollar.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * 0.5 = 1 dollar.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * 1 = 3 dollars.\nTherefore, a crate of fruit consists of 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 bananas,\n7 * 1 = 7 apples, and 7 * 3 = 21 oranges.\nSo the crate costs 2.5 * 2 + 7 * 1 + 21 * 3 = 5 + 7 + 63 = 75 dollars.\n#### 75\n"}, {"text": "\nOne apple costs $0.5, so 12 apples cost 12 * 0.5 = $6.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs 0.5 * 2 = $1.\nSo one crate of fruit consists of 5 * 1 = 5 bananas, 12 * 2 = 24 apples, and 7 * 3 = 21 oranges.\nThe price of a crate of fruit would be 5 * 1 + 24 * 2 + 21 * 3 = $11 + 48 + 63 = $124.\n#### 124\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
