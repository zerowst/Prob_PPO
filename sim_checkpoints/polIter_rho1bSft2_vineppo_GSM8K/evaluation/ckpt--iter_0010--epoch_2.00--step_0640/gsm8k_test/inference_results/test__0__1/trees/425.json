She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?\n\nSolution:\nLillian has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.\nThe store-bought feeders each attract 20 birds and Lillian has 6 of them so she has 6 * 20 = 120 birds coming to her feeders.\nThe feeders she made herself each attract 10 more birds than the store-bought feeders and she has 6 of them so they each attract 10 + 20 = 30 birds.\nLillian has 3 + 6 = 9 feeders of her own which each attract 30 birds so they each attract 9 * 30 = 270 birds.\nLillian has 120 birds coming to her feeders from the store-bought ones and 270 birds coming from her own feeders for a total of 120 + 270 = 390 birds coming to her feeders.\n#### 390\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.288775876164436, "len_probs": 216, "answer": "\nLillian has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.\nThe store-bought feeders each attract 20 birds and Lillian has 6 of them so she has 6 * 20 = 120 birds coming to her feeders.\nThe feeders she made herself each attract 10 more birds than the store-bought feeders and she has 6 of them so they each attract 10 + 20 = 30 birds.\nLillian has 3 + 6 = 9 feeders of her own which each attract 30 birds so they each attract 9 * 30 = 270 birds.\nLillian has 120 birds coming to her feeders from the store-bought ones and 270 birds coming from her own feeders for a total of 120 + 270 = 390 birds coming to her feeders.\n#### 390\n"}]}
