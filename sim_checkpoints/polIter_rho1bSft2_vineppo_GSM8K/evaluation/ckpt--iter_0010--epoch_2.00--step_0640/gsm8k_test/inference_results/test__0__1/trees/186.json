The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?\n\nSolution:\nThe 10 cages of hamsters have a total of 10*5 = 50 pieces of straw.\nIf 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, then there are 160/6 = 26.67 pieces of straw left.\nIn the 3 cages of rats, there are a total of 26.67/6 = 4.57 pieces of straw left.\nIn the 3 cages of rats, there are a total of 4.57/4 = 1.14 pieces of straw left.\nTherefore, there are 1.14/3 = 0.38 rats in each cage.\n#### 0.38\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.727470204234123, "len_probs": 175, "answer": "\nThe 10 cages of hamsters have a total of 10*5 = 50 pieces of straw.\nIf 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, then there are 160/6 = 26.67 pieces of straw left.\nIn the 3 cages of rats, there are a total of 26.67/6 = 4.57 pieces of straw left.\nIn the 3 cages of rats, there are a total of 4.57/4 = 1.14 pieces of straw left.\nTherefore, there are 1.14/3 = 0.38 rats in each cage.\n#### 0.38\n"}]}
