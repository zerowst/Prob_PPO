The larger box costs $4.80. The smaller box costs $3.40. What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?\n\nSolution:\nThe larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces. The larger box is 30/20 = 1.5 times bigger than the smaller box.\nThe larger box costs $4.80 and the smaller box costs $3.40. The difference in price is $4.80 - $3.40 = $1.40.\nThis means that for the price of 1.5 times more macaroni and cheese, you get 1.5*100 = 150 cents more.\nSo, the better value is the box with 150 cents per ounce.\n#### 150\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.732746481895447, "len_probs": 157, "answer": "\nThe larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces.
