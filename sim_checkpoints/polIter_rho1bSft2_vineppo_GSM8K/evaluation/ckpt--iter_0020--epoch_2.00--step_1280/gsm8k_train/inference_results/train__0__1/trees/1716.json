Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount of money that was collected is $50 x 25 = $1250.\nThe number of students who paid full amount is 25 - 4 = 21 students.\nThe amount paid by each of the 21 students is $50/2 = $25.\nSo, the amount collected from the 21 students is 21 x $25 = $525.\nThus, the total amount gathered from the 4 students who paid half is $525 x 4 = $210.\nTherefore, the total amount gathered by the class is $1250 + $210 = $1460.\n#### 1460\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.078350320458412, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nThe total amount of money that was collected is $50 x 25 = $1250.\nThe number of students who paid full amount is 25 - 4 = 21 students.\nThe amount paid by each of the 21 students is $50/2 = $25.\nSo, the amount collected from the 21 students is 21 x $25 = $525.\nThus, the total amount gathered from the 4 students who paid half is $525 x 4 = $210.\nTherefore, the total amount gathered by the class is $1250 + $210 = $1460.\n#### 1460\n"}]}
