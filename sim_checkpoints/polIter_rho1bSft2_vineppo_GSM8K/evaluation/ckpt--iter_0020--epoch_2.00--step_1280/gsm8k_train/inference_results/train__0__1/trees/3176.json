The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?\n\nSolution:\nSince the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, then the sales of carrots is 57 x 2 = $114.\nThe sales of half of the sales of carrots is (114/2) = $57.\nThen, the sales of the spinach is 57 + 16 = $73.\nThus, the sales of the broccoli is $57, the sales of the carrots is $114, the sales of the spinach is $73, and the sales of the cauliflower is $380 - (57 + 114 + 73) = $380 - 244 = $136.\n#### 136\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.058174431324005, "len_probs": 180, "answer": "\nSince the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, then the sales of carrots is 57 x 2 = $114.\nThe sales of half of the sales of carrots is (114/2) = $57.\nThen, the sales of the spinach is 57 + 16 = $73.\nThus, the sales of the broccoli is $57, the sales of the carrots is $114, the sales of the spinach is $73, and the sales of the cauliflower is $380 - (57 + 114 + 73) = $380 - 244 = $136.\n#### 136\n"}, {"text": "\nThe sales of carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, so the sales of carrots are 2 * $57 = $114.\nHalf of the sales of carrots is $114 / 2 = $57.\nSo the sales of spinach are $57 + $16 = $73.\nThe sales of broccoli, carrots, and spinach add up to $57 + $114 + $73 = $244.\nThus, the sales of cauliflower is $380 - $244 = $136.\n#### 136\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMaya's organization hosted a weekly farmers' market to raise money for the church choir.
