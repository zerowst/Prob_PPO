A shirt costs $7.50, a pair of pants cost $15, and socks cost $4.50 each if each team member buys the uniform items on their own. If they buy the items as a group, they are given a discount. A discounted shirt cost $6.75, a discounted pair of pants cost $13.50, and discounted socks cost $3.75. How much would their team of 12 save with the group discount?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for each team member to buy the items individually is $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27.\nThe total cost for 12 team members to buy the items individually is $27 x 12 = $324.\nThe total cost for the team to buy the items on their own is $6.75 x 12 + $13.50 x 12 + $3.75 x 12 = $324.\nThe total cost for the team to buy the items on their own with the group discount is $324 x (1 - 1/6) = $243.\nThus, the team would save $324 - $243 = $81 by purchasing the team discount.\n#### 81\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.622481893748045, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nThe total cost for each team member to buy the items individually is $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27.\nThe total cost for 12 team members to buy the items individually is $27 x 12 = $324.\nThe total cost for the team to buy the items on their own is $6.75 x 12 + $13.50 x 12 + $3.75 x 12 = $324.\nThe total cost for the team to buy the items on their own with the group discount is $324 x (1 - 1/6) = $243.\nThus, the team would save $324 - $243 = $81 by purchasing the team discount.\n#### 81\n"}, {"text": "\nThe cost of a shirt is $7.50 and a pair of pants is $15 so $7.50 + $15 = $22.50 for two items.\nIf they buy the items individually, the cost is $22.50 for two items so the savings is $22.50 - $22.50 = $0.\nThe discounted price for a shirt is $6.75, a pair of pants is $13.50, and socks are $3.75 so $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $23.00 for all three items.\nIf they buy the items as a group, the total cost is $23.00 for all three items so the savings is $23.00 - $22.50 = $0.50.\nThe team of 12 would save $0.50 with the group discount.\n#### 0.50\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEach member of Greg\u2019s softball team needs to buy one uniform made up of a shirt, a pair of pants, and socks.
