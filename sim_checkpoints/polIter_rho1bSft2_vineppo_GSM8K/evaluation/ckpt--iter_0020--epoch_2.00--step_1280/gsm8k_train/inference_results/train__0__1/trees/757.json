The elevator needs to move down 20 floors to reach the bottom. It takes 15 minutes for the elevator to travel down the first half of the floors. The elevator then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors. It then takes 16 minutes per floor for the elevator to finish traveling down the final 5 floors. In hours, how long did it take for the elevator to reach the bottom?\n\nSolution:\nThe elevator traveled down the first 10 floors in 15 minutes.\nIt then traveled down the next 5 floors, which took 5 minutes per floor, for a total of 5*5=25 minutes.\nFinally, it took 5 floors * 16 minutes per floor = 80 minutes to travel the final 5 floors.\nThus, in total, it took 15+25+80=120 minutes to travel down all of the floors.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, it took 120/60=2 hours to reach the bottom.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.358514852821827, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nThe elevator traveled down the first 10 floors in 15 minutes.\nIt then traveled down the next 5 floors, which took 5 minutes per floor, for a total of 5*5=25 minutes.\nFinally, it took 5 floors * 16 minutes per floor = 80 minutes to travel the final 5 floors.\nThus, in total, it took 15+25+80=120 minutes to travel down all of the floors.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, it took 120/60=2 hours to reach the bottom.\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nThe elevator traveled down the first 10 floors in 15 minutes.\nIt took 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors.\nSo it took 5*5 = 25 minutes to travel down the next 5 floors.\nIt then took 16 minutes per floor to travel down the final 5 floors.\nSo it took 16*5 = 80 minutes to travel down the final 5 floors.\nIn total, it took 15 minutes for the first half + 25 minutes for the next half + 80 minutes for the final half = 120 minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, it took 120/60 = 2 hours for the elevator to reach the bottom.\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMichael is stuck in an elevator that is slowly moving to the bottom floor.
