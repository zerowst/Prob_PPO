She likes to put a couple of sprigs of parsley on each plate for decoration. However, she is very low on parsley and doesn't have enough to even put 1 sprig on every plate, so she needs to break several of the parsley sprigs in two to make 2 smaller ones to stretch them out. If she decorates 8 plates with one whole parsley sprig and 12 plates with 1/2 a sprig each, how many sprigs of parsley does she have left if she started with 25?\n\nSolution:\nShe used 2 sprigs to make 2 smaller sprigs from 1 whole sprig, so she used 2 sprigs/2 smaller sprigs = 1 sprig per whole sprig used.\nShe used 8 whole sprigs, so she used 8 sprigs/sprig = 8 sprigs\nShe used 12 halves to make 12 plates, so she used 12/2 = 6 sprigs per plate.\nShe used 6 sprigs/plate, so she used 6*12 = 72 sprigs\nShe started with 25, so she has 25-72 = -47\nShe has 47 less than she started with\n#### 47\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.532241109758615, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nShe used 2 sprigs to make 2 smaller sprigs from 1 whole sprig, so she used 2 sprigs/2 smaller sprigs = 1 sprig per whole sprig used.\nShe used 8 whole sprigs, so she used 8 sprigs/sprig = 8 sprigs\nShe used 12 halves to make 12 plates, so she used 12/2 = 6 sprigs per plate.\nShe used 6 sprigs/plate, so she used 6*12 = 72 sprigs\nShe started with 25, so she has 25-72 = -47\nShe has 47 less than she started with\n#### 47\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, we need to figure out how many whole sprigs of parsley Carmen started with.
