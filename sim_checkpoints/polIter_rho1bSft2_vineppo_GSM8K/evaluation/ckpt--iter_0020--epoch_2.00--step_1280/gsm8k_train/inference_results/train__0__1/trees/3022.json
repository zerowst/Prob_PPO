Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?\n\nSolution:\nBess throws the Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters each time = 80 meters.\nBess throws the Frisbee back 4 times * 20 meters each time = 80 meters.\nWhen Bess throws the Frisbee the second time, she throws it 20 meters away and then throws it back 20 meters, so it travels 20 + 20 = 40 meters.\nWhen Bess throws the Frisbee the third time, she throws it 20 meters away and then throws it back 20 meters, so it travels 20 + 20 = 40 meters.\nWhen Bess throws the Frisbee the fourth time, she throws it 20 meters away and then throws it back 20 meters, so it travels 20 + 20 = 40 meters.\nThe total distance traveled by the Frisbees is 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 meters.\n#### 240\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.757584020495415, "len_probs": 242, "answer": "\nBess throws the Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters each time = 80 meters.\nBess throws the Frisbee back 4 times * 20 meters each time = 80 meters.\nWhen Bess throws the Frisbee the second time, she throws it 20 meters away and then throws it back 20 meters, so it travels 20 + 20 = 40 meters.\nWhen Bess throws the Frisbee the third time, she throws it 20 meters away and then throws it back 20 meters, so it travels 20 + 20 = 40 meters.\nWhen Bess throws the Frisbee the fourth time, she throws it 20 meters away and then throws it back 20 meters, so it travels 20 + 20 = 40 meters.\nThe total distance traveled by the Frisbees is 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 meters.\n#### 240\n"}, {"text": "\nBess throws the Frisbee 20 meters each time, for a total of 20*4 = 80 meters.\nShe throws it back to her original position, so it travels an additional 20 meters.\nHolly throws the Frisbee 8 meters each time, for a total of 8*5 = 40 meters.\nShe throws it back to her original position, so it travels an additional 8 meters.\nIn total, each player has thrown the Frisbee 80+40 = 120 meters.\nSince they are throwing the Frisbee in a circle, the total distance traveled is 120*2 = 240 meters.\n#### 240\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park.
