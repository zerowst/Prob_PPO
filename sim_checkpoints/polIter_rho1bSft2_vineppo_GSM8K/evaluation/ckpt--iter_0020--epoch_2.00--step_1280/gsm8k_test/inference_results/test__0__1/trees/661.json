The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?\n\nSolution:\nThe normal brand of coffee cost $5 per pound and he bought a week's worth so that's 5*7 = $35\nThe more expensive brand is 20% more expensive than the normal brand so it cost 5*1.2 = $6 more than the normal brand\nThe more expensive brand is $5 + $6 = $11 per pound\nHe bought 1 pound of coffee per day and a donut for $2 so that's 1*11 + 2 = $13 per day\nHe used 1 pound of coffee a day for 7 days so that's 1*7 = 7 pounds\nHe spent $13 per day for 7 days so that's 13*7 = $91 for the coffee\nHe also bought a donut for $2 so his total cost was 91+2 = $93\n#### 93\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.63333649933338, "len_probs": 205, "answer": "\nThe normal brand of coffee cost $5 per pound and he bought a week's worth so that's 5*7 = $35\nThe more expensive brand is 20% more expensive than the normal brand so it cost 5*1.2 = $6 more than the normal brand\nThe more expensive brand is $5 + $6 = $11 per pound\nHe bought 1 pound of coffee per day and a donut for $2 so that's 1*11 + 2 = $13 per day\nHe used 1 pound of coffee a day for 7 days so that's 1*7 = 7 pounds\nHe spent $13 per day for 7 days so that's 13*7 = $91 for the coffee\nHe also bought a donut for $2 so his total cost was 91+2 = $93\n#### 93\n"}]}
