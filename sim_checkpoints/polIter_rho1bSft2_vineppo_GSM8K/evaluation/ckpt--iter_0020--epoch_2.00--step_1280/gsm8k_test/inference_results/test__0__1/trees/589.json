If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. What will be the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Martin loses or gains per week. We do this by dividing the number of pounds lost or gained per day by the number of days in a week.\nCheerios: 1.25 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 0.175 pounds/day\nDonuts: 1.75 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 0.25 pounds/day\nNext, we subtract the weight loss per week from the weight gain per week to find the net weight change per week.\n0.25 pounds/day - 0.175 pounds/day = 0.075 pounds/day\nNow we multiply the daily weight change by the number of days in the week to find the weekly difference.\n0.075 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 0.575 pounds/week\nFinally, we multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in the 5 week period to find the total difference in weight.\n5 weeks * 0.575 pounds/week = 2.875 pounds\n#### 2.875\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.886663496494293, "len_probs": 260, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Martin loses or gains per week.
