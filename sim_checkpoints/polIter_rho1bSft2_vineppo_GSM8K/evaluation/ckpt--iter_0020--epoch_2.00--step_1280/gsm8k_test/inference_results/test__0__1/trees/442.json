Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the house temperature: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees\nThen add that amount to the starting temperature to find the temperature after baking: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = 55 degrees\nThen find how many degrees the house cooled down: 2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes = 6 degrees\nThen subtract that amount from the temperature after baking to find the temperature after the window is open: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees\nThen add the amount of heat the window provided to the temperature after the window is open to find the final temperature: 49 degrees + 2 degrees = 51 degrees\n#### 51\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -10.069945514202118, "len_probs": 166, "answer": "\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the house temperature: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees\nThen add that amount to the starting temperature to find the temperature after baking: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = 55 degrees\nThen find how many degrees the house cooled down: 2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes = 6 degrees\nThen subtract that amount from the temperature after baking to find the temperature after the window is open: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees\nThen add the amount of heat the window provided to the temperature after the window is open to find the final temperature: 49 degrees + 2 degrees = 51 degrees\n#### 51\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raises the house temperature: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen subtract that amount from the initial temperature to find how much the house temperature decreases: 40 degrees - 15 degrees = 25 degrees.\nThen find how many 10-minute intervals there are in 30 minutes: 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.\nThen multiply the number of intervals by the temperature decrease per interval to find the total temperature decrease: 3 intervals * 25 degrees/interval = 75 degrees.\nFinally, subtract the temperature decrease from the initial temperature to find the final temperature: 40 degrees - 75 degrees = -35 degrees.\nSince the temperature can't be negative, the house's temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit.\n#### 35\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
