On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday and Tuesday, he watched a total of 2 * 1 hour episode = 2 hours.\nOn Thursday, he watched a total of 1 + 30 = 31 minutes.\nOn Friday, he watched a total of 2 * 1 hour episode = 2 hours.\nSo he watched a total of 2 + 31 + 2 = 37 minutes on Friday.\nThis means he watched a total of 37 / 30 = 1.2 shows on Friday.\nTherefore, he watched 7 - 3 = 4 hours of TV on Wednesday.\nThis means he watched a total of 4 / 30 = 0.133 shows on Wednesday.\nSince he can watch up to 1 show, he must have watched 0.133 * 1 = 0.133 shows on Wednesday.\nThis means he watched 0.133 - 0.1 = 0.033 shows on Wednesday, which is 33 minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he watched 33 / 60 = 0.55 shows on Wednesday.\nSince he only watched 0.55 shows, he must have watched 0.55 - 1 = -0.45 shows on Wednesday, which is not possible.\nTherefore, there must be some mistake in the question.\n#### 0.45\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.087138004601, "len_probs": 337, "answer": "\nOn Monday and Tuesday, he watched a total of 2 * 1 hour episode = 2 hours.\nOn Thursday, he watched a total of 1 + 30 = 31 minutes.\nOn Friday, he watched a total of 2 * 1 hour episode = 2 hours.\nSo he watched a total of 2 + 31 + 2 = 37 minutes on Friday.\nThis means he watched a total of 37 / 30 = 1.2 shows on Friday.\nTherefore, he watched 7 - 3 = 4 hours of TV on Wednesday.\nThis means he watched a total of 4 / 30 = 0.133 shows on Wednesday.\nSince he can watch up to 1 show, he must have watched 0.133 * 1 = 0.133 shows on Wednesday.\nThis means he watched 0.133 - 0.1 = 0.033 shows on Wednesday, which is 33 minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he watched 33 / 60 = 0.55 shows on Wednesday.\nSince he only watched 0.55 shows, he must have watched 0.55 - 1 = -0.45 shows on Wednesday, which is not possible.\nTherefore, there must be some mistake in the question.\n#### 0.45\n"}]}
