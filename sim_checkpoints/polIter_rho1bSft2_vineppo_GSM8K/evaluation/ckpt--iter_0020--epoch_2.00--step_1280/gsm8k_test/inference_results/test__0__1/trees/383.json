She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie makes 12 cups of lemonade per pitcher and she sells each cup for $1 so she makes 12*1 = $12 per pitcher\nShe spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade and she makes 3 pitchers*12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade\nShe makes 36 cups of lemonade and sells 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open so she sells 36/4 = 9 hours worth of lemonade\nIf she makes an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open then she makes 9 hours * 4 cups per hour = 36 cups of lemonade\nIf she sells all of the lemonade then she makes 36-18 = 18 cups of lemonade that she doesn't sell\nIf she sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open then she makes an average of 18/4 = 4.5 hours that she doesn't sell lemonade\nIf she makes an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open then she makes an average of 4.5 hours that she doesn't sell lemonade * $1 profit per hour = $4.50 profit per hour that she doesn't sell lemonade\n#### 4.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.806017223745584, "len_probs": 334, "answer": "\nMillie makes 12 cups of lemonade per pitcher and she sells each cup for $1 so she makes 12*1 = $12 per pitcher\nShe spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade and she makes 3 pitchers*12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade\nShe makes 36 cups of lemonade and sells 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open so she sells 36/4 = 9 hours worth of lemonade\nIf she makes an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open then she makes 9 hours * 4 cups per hour = 36 cups of lemonade\nIf she sells all of the lemonade then she makes 36-18 = 18 cups of lemonade that she doesn't sell\nIf she sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open then she makes an average of 18/4 = 4.5 hours that she doesn't sell lemonade\nIf she makes an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open then she makes an average of 4.5 hours that she doesn't sell lemonade * $1 profit per hour = $4.50 profit per hour that she doesn't sell lemonade\n#### 4.5\n"}]}
