The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. We do this by multiplying the length by the width by the height, 25*14*4 = 1960 cubic feet.\nThen we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons are needed, 1960*5.9 = 11,240 gallons.\nFinally, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find out how much it will cost, 11,240*0.10 = $1,124.\n#### 1124\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.228629551827908, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool.
