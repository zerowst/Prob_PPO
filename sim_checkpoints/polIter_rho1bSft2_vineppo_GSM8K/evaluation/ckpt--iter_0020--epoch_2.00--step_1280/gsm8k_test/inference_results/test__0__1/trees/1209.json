So, over 3 days, it removes 3*1 = 3 liters of water.\nOn the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting. So, it removes 2*1 = 2 liters of water per day. Over 3 days, it removes 3*2 = 6 liters of water.\nOn the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting. So, it removes 2*2 = 4 liters of water per day. Over 5 days, it removes 5*4 = 20 liters of water.\nIn total, over the 3+3+5 days, the dehumidifier removes 3+6+20 = 30 liters of water from the air in Brian's basement.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.38020358979702, "len_probs": 214, "answer": "\nOn the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
