Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, she wakes up 6 - 10 = 4 hours late.\nThis means she slept for 4 hours + 2.38 hours = 6.38 hours.\nBut she also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, which means she slept for 6.38 - 0.05 = 6.33 hours.\nSo, in minutes, she slept for 6.33 x 60 = 379 minutes.\n#### 379\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.972225677222013, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, she wakes up 6 - 10 = 4 hours late.\nThis means she slept for 4 hours + 2.38 hours = 6.38 hours.\nBut she also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, which means she slept for 6.38 - 0.05 = 6.33 hours.\nSo, in minutes, she slept for 6.33 x 60 = 379 minutes.\n#### 379\n"}, {"text": "\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So she wakes up 6 - 10 = -4 hours late.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes into the night.\nShe woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she went to bed at 10 - 5 = 5 p.m.\nSo, she slept from 5 p.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 2:38 - 5 = 2:33 a.m.\nThus, she slept for 2:33 - 2:15 = 18 minutes.\n#### 18\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room.
