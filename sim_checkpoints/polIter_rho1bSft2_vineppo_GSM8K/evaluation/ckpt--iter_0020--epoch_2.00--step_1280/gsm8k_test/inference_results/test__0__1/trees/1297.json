How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?\n\nSolution:\nTo make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey, for a total of 2+1.5+2 = 5.5 pounds.\nHe pays 6 dollars per pound for passion fruit, 8 dollars per pound for jackfruit, and 10 dollars per pound for honey, for a total of 6+8+10 = $24 per pound.\nHe sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of 50-24 = $26 per pound.\nThus, Tim makes a profit of 26*5.5 = $141 per jar.\nSince he sells 10 jars, his total profit is 141*10 = $1410.\n#### 1410\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.329636011272669, "len_probs": 204, "answer": "\nTo make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey, for a total of 2+1.5+2 = 5.5 pounds.\nHe pays 6 dollars per pound for passion fruit, 8 dollars per pound for jackfruit, and 10 dollars per pound for honey, for a total of 6+8+10 = $24 per pound.\nHe sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of 50-24 = $26 per pound.\nThus, Tim makes a profit of 26*5.5 = $141 per jar.\nSince he sells 10 jars, his total profit is 141*10 = $1410.\n#### 1410\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the cost per pound of passion fruit: $6/pound * 2 pounds = $12/pound\nThen find the cost per pound of jackfruit: $8/pound * 1.5 pounds = $12/pound\nThen find the total cost of the passion fruit and jackfruit per jar: $12/pound + $12/pound = $24/pound\nThen find the total cost of the honey per jar: $10/pound\nThen find the total cost of the ingredients per jar: $24/pound + $10/pound = $34/pound\nThen find the profit per jar: $50 - $34/pound = $16/pound\nThen multiply the profit per jar by the number of jars to find the total profit: $16/pound * 10 jars = $160\n#### 160\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim makes a special honey and jam mix.
