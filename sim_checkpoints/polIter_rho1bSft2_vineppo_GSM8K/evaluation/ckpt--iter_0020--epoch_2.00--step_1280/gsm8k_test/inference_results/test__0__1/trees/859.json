How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?\n\nSolution:\nIf each of the 40 customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip, then the total amount of tips given by the customers is 40*20 = $800.\nRafaela received 10% more money in tips than Julieta. This means that if Julieta received $x, then 10% of x is equal to the difference between what she received and what Rafaela received. This can be written as 0.1x = x - $800.\nSolving for x, we get x = $800*0.9 = $720.\nThus, both Rafaela and Julieta received $720 in tips.\nAltogether, they received $720+$800 = $1520.\n#### 1520\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.08429964631796, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nIf each of the 40 customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip, then the total amount of tips given by the customers is 40*20 = $800.\nRafaela received 10% more money in tips than Julieta.
