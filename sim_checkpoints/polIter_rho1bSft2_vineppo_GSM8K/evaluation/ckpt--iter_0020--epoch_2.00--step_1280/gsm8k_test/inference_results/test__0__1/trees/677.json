During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?\n\nSolution:\nAfter five weeks, Carol has collected 20 signatures, and Jennifer has collected 44 signatures. Together, they have collected 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.\nTo reach their goal of 100 signatures, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.\nSince Carol and Jennifer have three more weeks of summer vacation, they will have 3 more weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.\nIf they collect 36 signatures in 21 days, they will need to collect 36 / 21 = 1.8 signatures/day.\nSince Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, they will need to collect 1.8 signatures/day * 20 signatures + 1.8 signatures/day * 44 signatures = 36 + 74 = 110 signatures in total.\n#### 110\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.313997499644756, "len_probs": 230, "answer": "\nAfter five weeks, Carol has collected 20 signatures, and Jennifer has collected 44 signatures.
