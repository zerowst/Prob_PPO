Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight is 15x. The total weight is equal to the weight of the driver plus the weight of the truck, which is 3755 pounds. This gives us the equation 15x = 3755.\nTo solve for x, we divide each side of the equation by 15, giving us x = 3755/15 = 253.\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck is 253.\n#### 253\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of boxes loaded onto the truck. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight is 15x. The total weight is equal to the weight of the driver plus the weight of the truck, which is 3755 pounds. This gives us the equation 15x = 3755.\nTo solve for x, we divide each side of the equation by 15, giving us x = 3755/15 = 253.\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck is 253.\n#### 253\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.989092111587524, "len_probs": 145, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of boxes loaded onto the truck.
