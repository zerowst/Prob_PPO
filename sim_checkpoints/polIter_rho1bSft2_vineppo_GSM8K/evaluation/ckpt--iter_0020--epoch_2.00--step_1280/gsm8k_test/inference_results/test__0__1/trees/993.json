Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe second plane flies to France and Germany, so each of its flights are split equally between the two countries, meaning it takes 44/2=22 flights to France.\nThe first plane, however, flies to Greece, so it takes 3/4*2=1.5 flights to Greece.\nThis means that the first plane takes 2-1.5=0.5 flights to Greece out of its total daily flights.\nSince the first plane flies 0.5 flights to Greece out of its 2 total flights, this means that 0.5/2=0.25 of its flights are to France.\nSince the first plane takes 0.25 of its flights to France, this means that 0.25*2=0.5 flights are to France.\n#### 0.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.96550315991044, "len_probs": 193, "answer": "\nThe second plane flies to France and Germany, so each of its flights are split equally between the two countries, meaning it takes 44/2=22 flights to France.\nThe first plane, however, flies to Greece, so it takes 3/4*2=1.5 flights to Greece.\nThis means that the first plane takes 2-1.5=0.5 flights to Greece out of its total daily flights.\nSince the first plane flies 0.5 flights to Greece out of its 2 total flights, this means that 0.5/2=0.25 of its flights are to France.\nSince the first plane takes 0.25 of its flights to France, this means that 0.25*2=0.5 flights are to France.\n#### 0.5\n"}]}
