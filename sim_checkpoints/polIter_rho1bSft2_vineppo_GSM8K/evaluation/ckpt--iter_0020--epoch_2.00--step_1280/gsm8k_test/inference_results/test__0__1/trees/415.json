Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30/2=15 apples.\nFrom the shortest trees, she gathered x/2 apples.\nFrom the average trees, she gathered x apples.\nSo the total number of apples she gathered is 15+x/2+x=500\nCombining like terms, we get 15+x/2+x=500\nMultiplying everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 30+x+2x=1000\nCombining like terms, we get 3x+30=1000\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 3x=970\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x=326.67\n#### 326.67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.141520965844393, "len_probs": 213, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30/2=15 apples.\nFrom the shortest trees, she gathered x/2 apples.\nFrom the average trees, she gathered x apples.\nSo the total number of apples she gathered is 15+x/2+x=500\nCombining like terms, we get 15+x/2+x=500\nMultiplying everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 30+x+2x=1000\nCombining like terms, we get 3x+30=1000\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 3x=970\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x=326.67\n#### 326.67\n"}, {"text": "\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount her sister gathered, so 30/2 = 15 apples.\nFrom the shortest trees, Joanne gathered more than half the amount her sister gathered, so she gathered 30/2 + 15 = 45 apples.\nHer sister gathered twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees, so 15*2 = 30 apples.\nHer sister gathered 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, so 45*3 = 135 apples.\nCombining the apples from the tallest and shortest trees, Joanne gathered 15+45 = 60 apples.\nSince the sisters gathered a total of 500 apples, Joanne gathered 500-60 = 440 apples.\nThus, Joanne gathered 440/2 = 220 apples from the average trees.\n#### 220\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family\u2019s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.
