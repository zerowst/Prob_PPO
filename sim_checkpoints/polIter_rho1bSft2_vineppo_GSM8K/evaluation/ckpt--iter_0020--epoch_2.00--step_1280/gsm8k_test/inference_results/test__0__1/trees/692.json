One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne apple costs $0.5, so two apples cost 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so they cost 3 * $1 = $3 per piece.\nSo one crate of fruit consists of 5 * $1 = $5 for bananas, 12 * $1 = $12 for apples, and 7 * $3 = $21 for oranges.\nThat means, one crate of fruit costs $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\n#### 38\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.288430780172348, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nOne apple costs $0.5, so two apples cost 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so they cost 3 * $1 = $3 per piece.\nSo one crate of fruit consists of 5 * $1 = $5 for bananas, 12 * $1 = $12 for apples, and 7 * $3 = $21 for oranges.\nThat means, one crate of fruit costs $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\n#### 38\n"}, {"text": "\nOne apple costs 0.5 dollars, so two apples cost 2 * 0.5 = $1.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * 0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so they cost 3 * 1 = $3 per piece.\nThus, one crate of such fruit consists of 5 * 0.5 = $2.5 of bananas, 12 * 1 = $12 of apples, and 7 * 3 = $21 of oranges.\nSo the price for a crate of fruit would be 2.5 + 12 + 21 = $35.\n#### 35\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
