Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?\n\nSolution:\nIf he buys 4 packs of bagels, he will get a discount of 10/100*10 = $1.00 off his total order.\nThis means his order will cost him 10-1 = $9.00\nSince he is buying 4 packs, he will receive 4*9 = 36 bagels.\nIf he buys 36 bagels, he will have to pay 36*1 = $36.00\nSince he has bought 4 packs, he is eligible for a discount. If he buys 4 packs, he will get a discount of 10/100*36 = $3.60.\nThis means he will pay 36-3.6 = $32.40 for his 4 bagels.\nSince he is buying 36 bagels, each bagel will cost him 32.40/36 = $0.89\n#### 0.89\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.639581076800823, "len_probs": 235, "answer": "\nIf he buys 4 packs of bagels, he will get a discount of 10/100*10 = $1.00 off his total order.\nThis means his order will cost him 10-1 = $9.00\nSince he is buying 4 packs, he will receive 4*9 = 36 bagels.\nIf he buys 36 bagels, he will have to pay 36*1 = $36.00\nSince he has bought 4 packs, he is eligible for a discount.
