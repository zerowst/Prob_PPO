Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive, and in the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many (30/2=15) came back. So in total, 30+15=45 bees left in the first 12 hours.\nTwo times as many bees as left in the first 12 hours left in the next 12 hours, so 2*45=90 bees left in the last 12 hours.\nSo in the last 6 hours, 90+45=135 bees returned to the hive.\n#### 135\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.17454607784748, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nIn the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive, and in the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many (30/2=15) came back.
