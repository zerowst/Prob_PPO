If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of balls that Jeffrey carried.\nJason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so he carried 2x balls.\nJordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so he carried 2(2x)=4x balls.\nSince all of the balls were carried in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is x+2x+4x=7x.\nSince Jason carried 2 balls, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 2x+7x=9x.\nSince we know that x=2, then the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 9(2)=18 balls.\n#### 18\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.840274184942245, "len_probs": 161, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of balls that Jeffrey carried.\nJason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so he carried 2x balls.\nJordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so he carried 2(2x)=4x balls.\nSince all of the balls were carried in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is x+2x+4x=7x.\nSince Jason carried 2 balls, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 2x+7x=9x.\nSince we know that x=2, then the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 9(2)=18 balls.\n#### 18\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of balls that Jason picked up and carried.\nJason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried x/2 balls.\nJordan carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so he carried 2(x/2)=x balls.\nIn total, the three boys carried x+x/2+x=3.5x balls.\nSince Jason carried 2 balls, the coach brought a total of 3.5x+2 balls.\nIf the coach brought a total of 10 balls, then 3.5x+2=10, which means 3.5x=8.\nTherefore, the coach brought x=8/3.5=2.285714285714286 balls to practice.\n#### 2.285714285714286\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCoach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.
