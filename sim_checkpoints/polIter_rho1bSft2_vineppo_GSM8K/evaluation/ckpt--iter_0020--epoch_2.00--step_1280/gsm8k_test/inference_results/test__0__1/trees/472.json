If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?\n\nSolution:\nLet c be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats, and c2 be the number of cookies he eats. We know that c2 = c/2 + 2.\nSubstituting c2 in the equation, we get c2 = c/2 + 2.\nSubtracting c/2 from both sides, we get c2 - c/2 = 2.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get 2c2 - c = 4.\nAdding c to both sides, we get 2c2 = c + 4.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get c2 = 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get c = 4.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.401320099830627, "len_probs": 182, "answer": "\nLet c be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats, and c2 be the number of cookies he eats.
