He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode the bike 5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times.\nSo he rode 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, he rode the bike 2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times.\nSo he rode 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers.\nTherefore, in total, Micheal rode 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.\n#### 860\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -10.184452541172504, "len_probs": 135, "answer": "\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode the bike 5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times.\nSo he rode 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, he rode the bike 2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times.\nSo he rode 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers.\nTherefore, in total, Micheal rode 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.\n#### 860\n"}]}
