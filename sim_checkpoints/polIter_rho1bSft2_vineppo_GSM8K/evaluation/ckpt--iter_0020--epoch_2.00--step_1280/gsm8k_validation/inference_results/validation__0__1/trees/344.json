the two players against Barca last season is 2x+y.\nSince the number of goals scored by the two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league, we can say that 20% of the goals scored in the league is equal to 2x+y.\nWe can also say that 100% of the goals scored in the league is equal to 100/20 * (2x+y) = 5(2x+y)\nThis means that 5(2x+y) = 300\nIf we divide both sides by 5, we get that 2x+y = 300/5 = 60\nIf we subtract y from both sides, we get that 2x = 60 - y\nIf we divide both sides by 2, we get that x = (60-y)/2\nWe know that x and y are both integers because they are the number of goals scored by two players, and the number of goals scored by two players is an integer.\nTherefore, the number of goals scored by each player is x = (60-y)/2 and y = (60-x)/2\nSince we know that x+y = 60/2 = 30, we can say that (60-y)/2 + (60-x)/2 = 30\nThis means that 60-y+60-x = 60*2 = 120\nThis means that 120 = 60 + y + x\nThis means that y + x = 60\nTherefore, we have two equations:\nx + y = 30\ny + x = 60\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get that 2y = 30\nTherefore, y = 30/2 = 15\nSubstituting y = 15 in the first equation, we get that x = 30-15 = 15\nTherefore, each player scored 15 goals each.\n#### 15\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last
