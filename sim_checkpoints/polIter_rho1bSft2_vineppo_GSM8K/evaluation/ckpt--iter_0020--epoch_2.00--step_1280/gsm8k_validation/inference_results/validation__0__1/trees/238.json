He wants to split them into three groups by age. If a third of the class is under 11 years, and two-fifths are above 11 but under 13, how many students will be in the third group (13 years and above)?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 45 students in the class. A third of the class is under 11 years, which means 45/3 = 15 students are under 11 years old.\nTwo-fifths of the class are above 11 but under 13, which means 2/5*45 = 18 students are above 11 but under 13 years old.\nThe number of students in the third group is the total number of students minus those in the first two groups: 45 - 15 - 18 = 12 students.\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.19087778031826, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nThere are 45 students in the class.
