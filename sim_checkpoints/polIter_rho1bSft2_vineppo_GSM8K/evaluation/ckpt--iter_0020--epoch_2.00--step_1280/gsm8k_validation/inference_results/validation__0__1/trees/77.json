There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach coin is worth $0.25, so each machine is worth 180 coins * $0.25/coin = $45.\nSo, if Erin had no money before she emptied the machines, and she had a total of $90 after emptying all of the machines, she must have had $90/45 coins = 2 machines.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.11578569188714, "len_probs": 140, "answer": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach coin is worth $0.25, so each machine is worth 180 coins * $0.25/coin = $45.\nSo, if Erin had no money before she emptied the machines, and she had a total of $90 after emptying all of the machines, she must have had $90/45 coins = 2 machines.\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nSince each machine holds the same amount of money, and Erin has a total of $90, this means that each machine holds $90 / 180 coins = $0.50.\nSince each machine holds $0.50, and Erin found that she had $0.00 after emptying all of the machines, this means that there must have been 0.50 / $0.00 = 50 machines in the launderette.\n#### 50\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
