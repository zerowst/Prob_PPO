She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 10 cars parked in the parking lot, and each car has 4 wheels, so there are 10*4=40 wheels in the parking lot, including Dylan's parents.\nSince Dylan's mother has two cars, and each of those cars has 4 wheels, then the 2 cars that Dylan's mother parked in the parking lot have a combined total of 2*4=8 wheels.\nThus, there are 40+8=48 car wheels in the parking lot.\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.9792620241642, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nThere are 10 cars parked in the parking lot, and each car has 4 wheels, so there are 10*4=40 wheels in the parking lot, including Dylan's parents.\nSince Dylan's mother has two cars, and each of those cars has 4 wheels, then the 2 cars that Dylan's mother parked in the parking lot have a combined total of 2*4=8 wheels.\nThus, there are 40+8=48 car wheels in the parking lot.\n#### 48\n"}]}
