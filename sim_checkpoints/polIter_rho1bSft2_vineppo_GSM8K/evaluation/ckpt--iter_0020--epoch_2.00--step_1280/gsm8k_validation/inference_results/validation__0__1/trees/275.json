A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe school paid $100 * 2 = $200 for the kindergarten library models.\nThe school paid $100 * 4 = $400 for the elementary library models.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten library models was $200 * 5% = $10.\nThe total cost for the elementary library models was $400 * 5% = $2.\nThus, the school paid $10 + $2 = $12 for the 6 models.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $12 * 2 = $24.\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.622744172811508, "len_probs": 204, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe school paid $100 * 2 = $200 for the kindergarten library models.\nThe school paid $100 * 4 = $400 for the elementary library models.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten library models was $200 * 5% = $10.\nThe total cost for the elementary library models was $400 * 5% = $2.\nThus, the school paid $10 + $2 = $12 for the 6 models.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $12 * 2 = $24.\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nSo, the school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nSo, the price of each model was reduced by 5/100*100 = $5.\nTherefore, the school paid 100 - 5 = $95 for each model.\nSince the school bought 6 models, they paid 6 x 95 = $570 in all.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
