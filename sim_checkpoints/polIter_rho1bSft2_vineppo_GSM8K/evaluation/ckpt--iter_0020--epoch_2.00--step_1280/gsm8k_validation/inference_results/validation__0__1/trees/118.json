But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nSolution:\nThe ship traveled 20 hours * 30 km/hr = 600 kilometers due east.\nIf the ship is one-third of the way to its destination, then it has traveled 1/3 * total distance to destination = 1/3 * 600 km = 200 km.\nThe ship was blown 200 km - 600 km = -400 km due west.\nSince the wind direction is considered negative, the ship was actually blown 400 km in the westward direction.\n#### 400\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.013948641717434, "len_probs": 135, "answer": "\nThe ship traveled 20 hours * 30 km/hr = 600 kilometers due east.\nIf the ship is one-third of the way to its destination, then it has traveled 1/3 * total distance to destination = 1/3 * 600 km = 200 km.\nThe ship was blown 200 km - 600 km = -400 km due west.\nSince the wind direction is considered negative, the ship was actually blown 400 km in the westward direction.\n#### 400\n"}, {"text": "\nThe ship traveled 20 hours * 30 km/hr = 600 kilometers due east.\nIf the ship was one-third of the way to its destination, it must have traveled 1/3 * 600 km = 200 kilometers.\nThus, the ship was blown 200 km - 600 km = -400 km due west.\nSince the wind direction is considered as negative, the ship was blown 400 km in the west direction.\n#### 400\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nOn the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down.
