Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?\n\nSolution:\nAna peels an orange every 3 minutes, so after an hour (60 minutes), she will peel: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per = 20 oranges.\nJane peels an orange every 4 minutes, so after an hour (60 minutes), she will peel: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per = 15 oranges.\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after 1 hour. Therefore, Ana will have peeled more.\nThis is because the difference between the amount of oranges Ana and Jane peel in 1 minute is 5, and this difference increases with each passing minute, so the difference between Ana's and Jane's amount of peeled oranges will increase.\nTherefore a total difference of 5*more = +5 more oranges by hour.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.426283994689584, "len_probs": 205, "answer": "\nAna peels an orange every 3 minutes, so after an hour (60 minutes), she will peel: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per = 20 oranges.\nJane peels an orange every 4 minutes, so after an hour (60 minutes), she will peel: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per = 15 oranges.\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after 1 hour.
