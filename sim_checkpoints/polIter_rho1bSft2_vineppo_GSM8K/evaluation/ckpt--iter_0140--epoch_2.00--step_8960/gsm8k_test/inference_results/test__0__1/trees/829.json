He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?\n\nSolution:\nThe second week, Boris only produces 8,000 * 0.5 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.\nThe third week, Boris produces 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.\nThe total amount of chocolate he produced from the first to the third week is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.\nThe total amount remaining in the first month (as he only baked for 1 of 4 weeks that week)\nSo the total for the month is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate.\nTherefore the answer is 4\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.24752474576235, "len_probs": 193, "answer": "\nThe second week, Boris only produces 8,000 * 0.5 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.\nThe third week, Boris produces 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.\nThe total amount of chocolate he produced from the first to the third week is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.\nThe total amount remaining in the first month (as he only baked for 1 of 4 weeks that week)\nSo the total for the month is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate.\nTherefore the answer is 4\n#### 4\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first week, Boris produces 8000\nIn the second week, Boris produces\n8000 * 0.5 = 4000\nIn the third week, Boris produces\n8000 * 3 = 24000\nSo the total amount of bars he produced in these three weeks is\n8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars.\nThe total amount of chocolate he has to produce left to finish the fourth month\nOf the 180 (months in a year)\n18\n\"of 4\nSo he has\n4 left\n#### 36000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBoris owns a chocolate factory.
