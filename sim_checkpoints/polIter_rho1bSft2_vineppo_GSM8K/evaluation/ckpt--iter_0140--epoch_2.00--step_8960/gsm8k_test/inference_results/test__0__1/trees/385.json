The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?\n\nSolution:\nThe choir has 0.5*52=26 boys and 0.5*52=26 girls.\nThe number of people that can sing is in the middle of the difference between the total number of boys and girls, which is (26+26)/2=25.\nHence the choir has, if no one was sick: 26-0.5*26=30\nAnd the choir's teachers sing in another 30, so 30\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.612257167696953, "len_probs": 120, "answer": "\nThe choir has 0.5*52=26 boys and 0.5*52=26 girls.\nThe number of people that can sing is in the middle of the difference between the total number of boys and girls, which is (26+26)/2=25.\nHence the choir has, if no one was sick: 26-0.5*26=30\nAnd the choir's teachers sing in another 30, so 30\n#### 30\n"}]}
