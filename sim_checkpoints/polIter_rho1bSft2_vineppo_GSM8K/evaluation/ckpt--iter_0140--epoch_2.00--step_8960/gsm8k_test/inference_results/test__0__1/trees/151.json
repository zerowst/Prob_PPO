She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?\n\nSolution:\nThe 5 bicycles came with a total of 5*2\nThe 3 tricycles came with a total of 3*(3\nAnd the last one on a unicycle came with nothing\nSo the total amount of bikes is 5+3+0\nWhich means there is 5+3\nSo 8 tires on bikes that she inflated\nSo she spent 5*25=125 cents\nSo she made 125/100*$2= 2.5\n#### 2.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.19719000160694, "len_probs": 125, "answer": "\nThe 5 bicycles came with a total of 5*2\nThe 3 tricycles came with a total of 3*(3\nAnd the last one on a unicycle came with nothing\nSo the total amount of bikes is 5+3+0\nWhich means there is 5+3\nSo 8 tires on bikes that she inflated\nSo she spent 5*25=125 cents\nSo she made 125/100*$2= 2.5\n#### 2.5\n"}]}
