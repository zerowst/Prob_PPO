Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes. So there are 6+2 = 8 periods in a day for John.\nEach period is 40 minutes long so he spends 40*8 = 320 minutes of his time\nHe goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 5*320 = 1600 minutes a week\nHe spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.\nHe has 2 of those extra hours each week so he has 2*1/16 = 0.125 hours\nHe gets that extra time each week from his 5 days a week so he 5\nThat means 5* 0.125 = 0.625 hours\n#### 0.625\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.72950842604041, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nThere are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.
