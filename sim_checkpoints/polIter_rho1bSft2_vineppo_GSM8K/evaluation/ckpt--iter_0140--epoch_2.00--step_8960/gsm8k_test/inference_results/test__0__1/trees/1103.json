A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nIf a fifth of the jellyfish are large and a third of those are green (which is not a big deal), then we can say there are\n5/1\n(large jellyfish)/\n3\n(green from large)=\n1\nlarge jellyfish\nSo 1\nlarge jellyfish\nwere large and\n4\n(small jellyfish)=\n4\nlarge jellyfish\nSo the\ntotal jellyfish\nis 1+4=5 jellyfish.\nIf\n6\njellyfish\nchanging color\nwere\nall\nsmall\n(small jellyfish stay blue),\nthen there\nare\n5\n*\n6\n=\n30\nsmall jellyfish\nin the tank.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -47.18384866416454, "len_probs": 168, "answer": "\nIf a fifth of the jellyfish are large and a third of those are green (which is not a big deal), then we can say there are\n5/1\n(large jellyfish)/\n3\n(green from large)=\n1\nlarge jellyfish\nSo 1\nlarge jellyfish\nwere large and\n4\n(small jellyfish)=\n4\nlarge jellyfish\nSo the\ntotal jellyfish\nis 1+4=5 jellyfish.\nIf\n6\njellyfish\nchanging color\nwere\nall\nsmall\n(small jellyfish stay blue),\nthen there\nare\n5\n*\n6\n=\n30\nsmall jellyfish\nin the tank.\n#### 5\n"}]}
