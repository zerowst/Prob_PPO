The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nSolution:\nFor the first venue, if it costs $200 for the event, the $200 is a flat fee.\nFor the number of guests, the equation is (number of guests - x) x $25 + $5 (given that it will cost x because it is not included in the meal) = $200\nWe can solve for x and find the number of guests that will be necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.\n\n(number of guests - x) x $25 + $5 = $200\n(number of guests - x) x $25 = $200 - $5\n(number of guests - x) x $25 = $195\n(number of guests - x) = $195 / $25\n(number of guests - x) = 7\nThe number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 7.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.28529907390475, "len_probs": 214, "answer": "\nFor the first venue, if it costs $200 for the event, the $200 is a flat fee.\nFor the number of guests, the equation is (number of guests - x) x $25 + $5 (given that it will cost x because it is not included in the meal) = $200\nWe can solve for x and find the number of guests that will be necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.\n\n(number of guests - x) x $25 + $5 = $200\n(number of guests - x) x $25 = $200 - $5\n(number of guests - x) x $25 = $195\n(number of guests - x) = $195 / $25\n(number of guests - x) = 7\nThe number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 7.\n#### 7\n"}, {"text": "\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200 for the flat fee plus the per-guest cost.\nFor example, let's say the first venue charged for 10 guests, so the total cost was\n$200 + (10 guests * $25/guest) = $200 + $250 = $450.\nThus, for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to have\n$450 = (for two venues)\nor\n$200 + (5 per guest)\nFor example, if\nfor two venues\n$200 + (5 * $50) = $200 + $250 = $450.\nThus, 5 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.\n#### 5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.
