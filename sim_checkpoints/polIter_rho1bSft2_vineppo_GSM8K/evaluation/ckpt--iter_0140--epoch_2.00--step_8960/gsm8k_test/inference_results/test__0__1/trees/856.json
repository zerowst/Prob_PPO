He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of glue sticks needed for all the students in Mr. Jackson\u2019s class is: 27 students x 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.\nIf each pack has 8 glue sticks, he will need to divide: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6 packs of glue\nAnd since Mr. Jackson won\u2019t get any remainder of the glue sticks after buying 6 full packs and it\u2019s a good thing because he expects to have some leftover, he will need to buy\n6 packs +\nOne more pack to add to his extra glue sticks.\nSo the answer to this question is 6+1 = 7 packs.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -56.323779828846455, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nThe total number of glue sticks needed for all the students in Mr. Jackson\u2019s class is: 27 students x 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.\nIf each pack has 8 glue sticks, he will need to divide: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6 packs of glue\nAnd since Mr. Jackson won\u2019t get any remainder of the glue sticks after buying 6 full packs and it\u2019s a good thing because he expects to have some leftover, he will need to buy\n6 packs +\nOne more pack to add to his extra glue sticks.\nSo the answer to this question is 6+1 = 7 packs.\n#### 7\n"}, {"text": "\nMr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, so he will need a total of 27 students * 2 = 54 glue sticks.\nThus, Mr. Jackson needs to get 54 / 8 = 6 packs of glue sticks, because he cannot buy only some of the pack.\nHowever, because he can only buy whole packs, the final result will be 6 packs for this reason.
