On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?\n\nSolution:\nOn Saturday the store sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.\nOn Sunday they sold 28 / 2\nthat many\n14\n(because if you take 2 off the 4\nthen you get the original amount back\nbecause you can't have half a pair of shoes)\nSo in total on the weekend they sold 14 + 28 +\n(their original number): 6\n6\n60\nTotal sold: 70 pairs of shoes.\n#### 70\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.757998526096344, "len_probs": 123, "answer": "\nOn Saturday the store sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.\nOn Sunday they sold 28 / 2\nthat many\n14\n(because if you take 2 off the 4\nthen you get the original amount back\nbecause you can't have half a pair of shoes)\nSo in total on the weekend they sold 14 + 28 +\n(their original number): 6\n6\n60\nTotal sold: 70 pairs of shoes.\n#### 70\n"}]}
