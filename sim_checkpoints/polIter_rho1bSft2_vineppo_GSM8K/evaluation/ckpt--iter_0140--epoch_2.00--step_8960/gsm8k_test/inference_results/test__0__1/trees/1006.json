The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1,050 cubic feet.\nThe cost for the company to fill it with water was $0.10/gallon x (total\nvolume/volume per gallon\n= 1,050 x 0.10\n= 105 gallons\nSo the bill to fill the pool is $0.10/gallon x 105 = $10.50\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.480262994766235, "len_probs": 118, "answer": "\nThe volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1,050 cubic feet.\nThe cost for the company to fill it with water was $0.10/gallon x (total\nvolume/volume per gallon\n= 1,050 x 0.10\n= 105 gallons\nSo the bill to fill the pool is $0.10/gallon x 105 = $10.50\n#### 10\n"}]}
