The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?\n\nSolution:\nThe shortest tree is 6 feet.\nThe second tree is 5 more feet than the shortest tree, or 6 + 5 = 11 feet.\nSo the first two trees combined is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.\nThe tallest tree is then, 17 x 2 =\n17 x 2\n= 34 feet tall.\nThe tall tree in this scenario is the 34 feet tall tree.\nA tall tree in this scenario is a 34 feet tall tree. It's the shortest task to be the shortest tree and the tallest to be the tallest.\nSo the answer is a 34 feet tall tree. <a>34</a>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -60.23743147403002, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe shortest tree is 6 feet.\nThe second tree is 5 more feet than the shortest tree, or 6 + 5 = 11 feet.\nSo the first two trees combined is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.\nThe tallest tree is then, 17 x 2 =\n17 x 2\n= 34 feet tall.\nThe tall tree in this scenario is the 34 feet tall tree.\nA tall tree in this scenario is a 34 feet tall tree.
