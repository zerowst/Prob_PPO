travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?\n\nSolution:\nIf we assume that each kangaroo travels at a constant speed, then they would take\n18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo\nIf we know that each kangaroo travels at a constant speed, we can say that each turtle takes an additional\n(18 - 6)\n= 6\nhours to travel,\nsince it takes one less hour for the additional\n6\nhours of travel time per kangaroo (relative to the kangaroo speed)\nfour turtles\n4\n(6)\n= 24\nhours total\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null,
