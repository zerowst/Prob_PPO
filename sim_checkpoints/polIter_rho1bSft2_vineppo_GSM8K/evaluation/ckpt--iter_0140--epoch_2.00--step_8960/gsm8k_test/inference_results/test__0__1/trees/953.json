Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nThe total time from 2:15 to 2:38 is 38 - 15 (seconds in a 60 minute hour\n= 2\nbecause there is no remainder in this part of the calculation.)\n= 2 min 58\nSo she was asleep for 6\n(total minutes in an hour)/60\n= 1\nSo the answer is 1\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.373881563544273, "len_probs": 94, "answer": "\nThe total time from 2:15 to 2:38 is 38 - 15 (seconds in a 60 minute hour\n= 2\nbecause there is no remainder in this part of the calculation.)\n= 2 min 58\nSo she was asleep for 6\n(total minutes in an hour)/60\n= 1\nSo the answer is 1\n#### 2\n"}]}
