She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?\n\nSolution:\nAda's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. So in one week (7 days), it is 7 x 12 = 84 kilowatts.\nHer weekly electric bill before adding the new device is $11 per week (as her consumption is 84 kWh at $1.50/kWh per month).\nSo her weekly electric bill is $11 x 4 (as there's only one month left in her current plan)\nThe amount she consumes on her new device is 2 kilowatts per hour\nHer new weekly electric consumption is 7\nHer new weekly electric bill is $8\nThe difference is $11 x 4 - $8 = $44\n#### 44\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.351565420627594, "len_probs": 174, "answer": "\nAda's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
