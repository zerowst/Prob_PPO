The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe eldest initially paid an amount that can be represented by $x.\nHe then added $5 and then another $10, so $x + 5 + 10 = $18\nThus $18 - 5 + 10 = $23 - x\nAfter he spent $8, he had $23 - x - 8 = $15 - x\nHe then spent $4 from his total so far, so $15 - x - 4 = $11 - x\nHe was able to triple the amount he had left, so $11 - x = 3( $x\nSo $11 - x = 3x\n$11 = 4x\n$3.5 = x\nSo he originally paid $3.5\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.336049616336823, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nThe eldest initially paid an amount that can be represented by $x.\nHe then added $5 and then another $10, so $x + 5 + 10 = $18\nThus $18 - 5 + 10 = $23 - x\nAfter he spent $8, he had $23 - x - 8 = $15 - x\nHe then spent $4 from his total so far, so $15 - x - 4 = $11 - x\nHe was able to triple the amount he had left, so $11 - x = 3( $x\nSo $11 - x = 3x\n$11 = 4x\n$3.5 = x\nSo he originally paid $3.5\n#### 11\n"}, {"text": "\nThe eldest started with $18 - $5 = $13 after adding $5 to his share.\nThe next day he added another $10 so his total became $13 + $10 = $23.\nHe spent some money, $8 so the total he had became $23 - $8 = $15\nHe spent a portion of this to make it $3\nSo, he has now $3 x = $4\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\n$18 is shared among 3 boys.
