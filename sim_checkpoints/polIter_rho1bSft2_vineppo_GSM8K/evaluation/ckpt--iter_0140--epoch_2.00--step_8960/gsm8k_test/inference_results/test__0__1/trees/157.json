Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran back and forth 15 times for a total distance of: 100 * 2 * 15 = 3000 yards.\nHe ran an additional 3000 \u2013 (first number)\n3\nSo the answer is 3000 \u2013 300 = 2700\nKelly ran 40*34 for a total of: 17\nSo Kelly ran an additional 17 \u2013 (first number)\n17 \u2013 3000 = -2830\n#### 2700\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.17225066572428, "len_probs": 131, "answer": "\nBlake ran back and forth 15 times for a total distance of: 100 * 2 * 15 = 3000 yards.\nHe ran an additional 3000 \u2013 (first number)\n3\nSo the answer is 3000 \u2013 300 = 2700\nKelly ran 40*34 for a total of: 17\nSo Kelly ran an additional 17 \u2013 (first number)\n17 \u2013 3000 = -2830\n#### 2700\n"}, {"text": "\nBlake ran 100 * 15 = 1500 yards.\nHe ran back and forth 15 times for a total distance of: 1500 * 2 = 3000 yards.\nKelly ran 15\nShe ran 40 -\nShe ran 10\nShe ran 1\nShe ran 4\nShe ran 4\nShe ran 2\nShe ran 4\nShe ran 6\nShe ran 3\nShe ran 4\nShe ran 5\nShe ran 6\nShe ran 4 more miles than Blake, for 3000-4 = 2976\nThe winner runs 2976-3000 = -34 yards more than the loser.\n#### 34\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBlake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes.
