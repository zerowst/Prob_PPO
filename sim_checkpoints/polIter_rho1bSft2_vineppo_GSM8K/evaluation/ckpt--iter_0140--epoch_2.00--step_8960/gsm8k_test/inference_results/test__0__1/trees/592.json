On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?\n\nSolution:\nThe cost of shipping on Amazon is $4, so the total price is $16 + $4 = $20.\nThe cost of shipping on eBay is $6, because twice as much as it is on Amazon.\nThus, the total is $20, $6\nSo the difference is $20 - $6 = $14. They are $14 more expensive on eBay.\nAlternatively,\nThe shipping cost is the same on both sites, so the difference there is $20\nThe total is the same so the difference is $14\n#### 14.\n#### <\n#### <\nYou can also do this with a calculator:\nThe difference is $14 because $20 - $12 = 8 (the difference is 8, because the other site has a free shipping option that we are not considering)\nThen just multiply by the cost of shipping: $14 * $6 = $84\nThen that\u2019s the difference in cost for the free shipping\nSo the answer is $84.\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -79.50562323629856, "len_probs": 246, "answer": "\nThe cost of shipping on Amazon is $4, so the total price is $16 + $4 = $20.\nThe cost of shipping on eBay is $6, because twice as much as it is on Amazon.\nThus, the total is $20, $6\nSo the difference is $20 - $6 = $14.
