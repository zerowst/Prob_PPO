How many stitches does each sleeve take?\n\nSolution:\nThe collar takes a tenth of 900 stitches, or 900/10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, or 2*90 = 180 stitches.\nThe whole sweater is made up of the body, collar, and rosette, so together there is a 90\nstitches (for the collar), 90 stitches\n(for the rosette), and together that\u2019s 9\nstitches in all\n(for the sleeves), a total of 1800-5\nstitches = 1750\n#### 175\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.49721807986498, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nThe collar takes a tenth of 900 stitches, or 900/10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, or 2*90 = 180 stitches.\nThe whole sweater is made up of the body, collar, and rosette, so together there is a 90\nstitches (for the collar), 90 stitches\n(for the rosette), and together that\u2019s 9\nstitches in all\n(for the sleeves), a total of 1800-5\nstitches = 1750\n#### 175\n"}, {"text": "\nThe collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.\nSo the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is\nThat means the total is 1800 \u2013 90 \u2013 90 = 810\nTherefore, they are 810 / 3 (the other two must add up to one side or the other, so the\nother two must each be half to make it equal 810, so each sleeve is 810 / 3 = 270 stitches.\n#### 270\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTerri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette.
