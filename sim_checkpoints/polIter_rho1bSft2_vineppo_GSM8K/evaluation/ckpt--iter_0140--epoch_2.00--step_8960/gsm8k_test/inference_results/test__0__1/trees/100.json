If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?\n\nSolution:\nThe second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, or 1/4*20 = 5 more times.\nSo, the total number of times the second friend pressed on the doorbell is 20 + 5 = 25 times.\nThe third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, or 10*60 = 60 more times.\nThe total number of times the third friend pressed on the doorbell is 60 + 60 = 120 times.\nIn total all four friends made 20 + 25 + 60 + 120 = 255 doorbell rings.\nThe number of doorbell rings made that day was 255.\nThe number of doorbell rings that we were trying to find out was a number of doorbells they could have made\nIt is not possible for a number to be greater than 255\nThe number of doorbell rings they made was 255.\nThe number of doorbell rings they could not have is 0.\n#### The answer to is 255 doorbells.\n#### 255\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -62.3599290587008, "len_probs": 269, "answer": "\nThe second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, or 1/4*20 = 5 more times.\nSo, the total number of times the second friend pressed on the doorbell is 20 + 5 = 25 times.\nThe third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, or 10*60 = 60 more times.\nThe total number of times the third friend pressed on the doorbell is 60 + 60 = 120 times.\nIn total all four friends made 20 + 25 + 60 + 120 = 255 doorbell rings.\nThe number of doorbell rings made that day was 255.\nThe number of doorbell rings that we were trying to find out was a number of doorbells they could have made\nIt is not possible for a number to be greater than 255\nThe number of doorbell rings they made was 255.\nThe number of doorbell rings they could not have is 0.\n#### The answer to is 255 doorbells.\n#### 255\n"}, {"text": "\nThe third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than 60 times, or 10(60 + more than 6\nthat was one friend, so\n6\n)=66 times more than\nthe friend who pressed on the doorbell 60 times\n4\n)=2\ntimes\nthe amount the second friend pressed\nsince the first friend pressed on the doorbell\n4\n+1/4\n=4.25\ntimes more than\nthe first friend\n4.25\n=8\ntimes\nthe amount the third friend pressed\nthe first friend\n+1\n=8\ntimes\nthe amount the first friend\n+\n=4\ntimes\nthe amount the second friend\n=20\n+4\n+8\n=32\ndoorbell rings\n#### 32\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day.
