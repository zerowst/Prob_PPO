The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.\n\nSolution:\nThe depreciation rate is constant, so we can use it to find the amount of depreciation each year. The initial value of the car (the starting amount) is $20000.\nThe year 2008 will depreciate: $20000 * (21/100) = $4200\nSo, the value of the car after 2008 is $20000 - $4200 = $15800.\nThe year 2009 will depreciate: $15800 * (21/100) = $3789\nSo, the value of the car after 2009 is $15800 - $3789 = $12011.\nThe year 2010 will depreciate: $12011 * (21/100) = $2421.1\nSo, the value of the car in 2010 is $12011 - $2421.1 = $9590.9.\n#### 9590.9\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.510468885302544, "len_probs": 267, "answer": "\nThe depreciation rate is constant, so we can use it to find the amount of depreciation each year.
