Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?\n\nSolution:\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered half this amount so 30 x 0.5 = 15\nHer sister gathered twice as many so 15 x 2 = 30\nFrom the shortest trees, Joanne gathered more so 30\nSo the total amount for Joanne from the shortest trees is total = act\nSo the total amount for Joanne\u2019s sister was 3\nSo the total amount is 15 + 30 + 5\nSo the answer is 50 = Joanne\u2019s average trees\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.593695804476738, "len_probs": 128, "answer": "\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered half this amount so 30 x 0.5 = 15\nHer sister gathered twice as many so 15 x 2 = 30\nFrom the shortest trees, Joanne gathered more so 30\nSo the total amount for Joanne from the shortest trees is total = act\nSo the total amount for Joanne\u2019s sister was 3\nSo the total amount is 15 + 30 + 5\nSo the answer is 50 = Joanne\u2019s average trees\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nFrom the tallest trees, Joanne gathered half this amount, which is 30 *\n\nSo, Joanne gathered 30 * 0.5 = 15 from the tallest trees.\n\nFrom the shortest trees, Joanne gathered more than this, but we don\u2019t know how much so, so we can ignore this for now.\n\nHer sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so they both gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees together.\n\nHer sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so they both gathered 30 * 3 = 90 apples from the shortest trees together.\n\nSo, from all three sources, Joanne gathered A\n\nFrom the average trees, Joanne gathered = X\nSo, Joanne gathered X = 500\n#### 15\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family\u2019s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.
