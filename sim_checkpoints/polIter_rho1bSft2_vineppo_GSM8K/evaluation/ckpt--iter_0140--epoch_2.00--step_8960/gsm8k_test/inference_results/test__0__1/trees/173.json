If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?\n\nSolution:\nThe amount Jessica pays each month for her student loans is $300/month. So, the yearly amount for her student loans is\n$300/month * 12 months/year = $360/year\nThe amount Jessica pays each month for her credit card is $200/month. So, the yearly amount for her credit card is\n$200/month * 12 months/year = $240/year\nThe amount Jessica pays each month for her mortgage is $500/month. So, the yearly amount for her mortgage is\n$500/month * 12 months/year = $600/year\nTherefore the yearly total for all three is\n$360/year + $240/year + $600/year\n$1100/year\n$1100/year * 12 months/year\n$13200/year\n#### 13200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.152166970074177, "len_probs": 234, "answer": "\nThe amount Jessica pays each month for her student loans is $300/month.
