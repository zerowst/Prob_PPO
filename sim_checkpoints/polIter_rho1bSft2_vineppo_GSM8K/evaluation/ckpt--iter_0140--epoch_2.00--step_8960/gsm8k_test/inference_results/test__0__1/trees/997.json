Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to figure out how much money was collected from the fund and online before his lawyer stepped in. So that means we start with: $500 + $1500 = $2000.\nWe know that all the other donations were worth this amount\nSo $200\nThat means his lawyer's contribution was the $3\nSo $3 x $200 = $600\n#### 600\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.38486775010824, "len_probs": 101, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to figure out how much money was collected from the fund and online before his lawyer stepped in.
