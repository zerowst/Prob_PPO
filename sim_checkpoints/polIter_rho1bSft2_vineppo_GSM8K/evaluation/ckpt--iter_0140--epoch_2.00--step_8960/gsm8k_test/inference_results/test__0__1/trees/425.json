She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?\n\nSolution:\nShe made 3 bird feeders and 3 others are just like they are\nSo the total birds are 3+1(one was already there)\nSo it is 3+3=6 birds\nThey each go 20+10=30\nSo they are 6 going, 2 each day\nSo the answer is 6.\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.57136734202504, "len_probs": 84, "answer": "\nShe made 3 bird feeders and 3 others are just like they are\nSo the total birds are 3+1(one was already there)\nSo it is 3+3=6 birds\nThey each go 20+10=30\nSo they are 6 going, 2 each day\nSo the answer is 6.\n#### 20\n"}, {"text": "\nShe made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 others for a total of: 3+3 (another 3) =\nso she has\n3*\n= 3\nbird feeders.\nThey each attract 20 birds,\nso she get\n3*20=\n60 birds a day.\nBut they also get 2 more that\nthey can't see\nthan the ones she bought,\nso that's an additional 10*\n= 20 extra birds\nthat she doesn't count.\nSo she gets an total of\n60+20=\n80 birds a day.\n#### 80\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nLillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some.
