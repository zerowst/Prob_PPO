At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?\n\nSolution:\nThe jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved a total of $6 from both = (total to save from joggers + from tattered\n)/total\nFrom this, we can deduce that\n$6 = x + (total from tattered jeans)\nx = total he saved from tattered jeans\ntotal he saved from tattered = $6\nso $6 = x + $6\nx = $0\nTherefore  $22 - $0 = $22 originally cost less than the tattered jeans.\n#### 22\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.52978575974703, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nThe jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved a total of $6 from both = (total to save from joggers + from tattered\n)/total\nFrom this, we can deduce that\n$6 = x + (total from tattered jeans)\nx = total he saved from tattered jeans\ntotal he saved from tattered = $6\nso $6 = x + $6\nx = $0\nTherefore  $22 - $0 = $22 originally cost less than the tattered jeans.\n#### 22\n"}, {"text": "\nThe jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved a total of $6 from both the jogger and the tattered jeans\nSo, the savings from the tattered jeans was\n$6 / [ 1 / \"the savings from the jogger jeans was the total he saved was\nSo the savings from the \"tattered jeans was\n$6 - (the savings from the jogger)]\nSo the \"the savings from the jogger jeans was\n$22\nSo the two saved were equal\nSo the \"the difference between the two original prices was\n$22 - $28 = $6\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest.
