After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?\n\nSolution:\nCarol has collected 20 signatures in her book and Jennifer has 44 signatures in her book. Together they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.\nThe sisters plan to keep collecting signatures for another three weeks. They will have 3 more weeks of summer vacation, or a grand total of 3*8 (since 1\nweek = 8 hours)\nThis means they will have 8 more hours to collect\n8*60 = 480 minutes (the average amount of time spent collecting signatures per hour in the summer vacation)\nThey will collect\n64 + (8\n*60\ntotal time spent\n)=\n288\nsignatures\n#### 288\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -56.006757255643606, "len_probs": 169, "answer": "\nCarol has collected 20 signatures in her book and Jennifer has 44 signatures in her book.
