We know that there are 100 minutes in an hour and 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the hours to minutes:\n3 days x (8 hours/day) = 24 hours\nSo Michael drives: 50 km/hr x 24 h = 1200 km.\nThat's the distance he covers in 3 days (we'll call it \"X\").\nSo the answer is X = 1200 km\nSo the percentage of the distance, (distance covered)/total distance, x 100%\nX/6,000 = 12\nSo Michael has covered 12% of the distance.\n#### 12\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMichael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?\n\nSolution:\nFirst we need to convert Michael's average speed from km/hr to km/day.
