She can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans. If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 17 x 2 = 34 red jelly beans.\nSo, there\u2019s a total of 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans.\nHence, there 60 \u2013 51 = 9 jelly beans that are blue.\nAnd this is the only type of jelly that is not in the \u201call-green\u201d group, so 9 is the answer, which is\nNOT\nthe correct answer.\nThe correct answer is the number of jelly beans that are either \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d in the jar, but not both.\nThere are, therefore, 2\nTo find the answer, there is a more complicated way:\nThere are total of 6 (60-51), which are blue jelly,\nAnd this is the only type of jelly that is not in the \u201call-green\u201d group, so this is the answer, which is\nNOT\nthe correct answer. The correct answer is the number of jelly beans that are either \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d in the jar, but not both.\n#### 9\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -98.71952557191253, "len_probs": 251, "answer": "\nThere are 17 x 2 = 34 red jelly beans.\nSo, there\u2019s a total of 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans.\nHence, there 60 \u2013 51 = 9 jelly beans that are blue.\nAnd this is the only type of jelly that is not in the \u201call-green\u201d group, so 9 is the answer, which is\nNOT\nthe correct answer.\nThe correct answer is the number of jelly beans that are either \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d in the jar, but not both.\nThere are, therefore, 2\nTo find the answer, there is a more complicated way:\nThere are total of 6 (60-51), which are blue jelly,\nAnd this is the only type of jelly that is not in the \u201call-green\u201d group, so this is the answer, which is\nNOT\nthe correct answer.
