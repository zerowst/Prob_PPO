Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?\n\nSolution:\nSize extra-small needs 11 x 2 = 22 students.\nSize small needs 2 x size extra-small\u2019s 2\nSo it needs\n= 2 x 2\n= 4\nSize medium needs 4 less than the 2\nSo it needs 4 +\n= 4\n= 4\nSize large needs half as many as medium\nSo it needs 4 /\n= 4\n= 4\nSize extra-large is 6 more than the\nSo it\u2019s\n6 more than\n= 4\n= 4\nTherefore, Krissa ordered 22 + 4 + 4 = 2\nAnd 4 extra-large shirts\nSo the answer to the question is 2(extra-large) = 8\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.9995742328465, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nSize extra-small needs 11 x 2 = 22 students.\nSize small needs 2 x size extra-small\u2019s 2\nSo it needs\n= 2 x 2\n= 4\nSize medium needs 4 less than the 2\nSo it needs 4 +\n= 4\n= 4\nSize large needs half as many as medium\nSo it needs 4 /\n= 4\n= 4\nSize extra-large is 6 more than the\nSo it\u2019s\n6 more than\n= 4\n= 4\nTherefore, Krissa ordered 22 + 4 + 4 = 2\nAnd 4 extra-large shirts\nSo the answer to the question is 2(extra-large) = 8\n#### 8\n"}, {"text": "\nSize extra-small needed:11\nTwice as many extra-small size students need size small as extra small\nSo size small needed is\n2(11)=22\nSize small students need size small\n2\n2 less than the 22 sized students\nare size medium\nSo the answer is\n2(17)=34\nSize medium needed are\n3\n4 less than the size medium\nsize\nSo the answer is\n3(3)=9\nSize large needed are\n3(3)=9\nSo the answer is\n9+9=18\nAnd\n18\n#### 18\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKrissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 11 students need size extra-small.
