If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?\n\nSolution:\nThe total revenue from marigolds is 12 pots x $2.74 = $32.\nThe total revenue from petunias is 9 pots x $1.87 = $16.93.\nThe total revenue from begonias is 17 pots x $2.12 = $35.04.\nThe total amount the three kinds of flowers would cost at the new price if rounded\nSo the total revenue would be $32 + $17\n= $50 (rounded to the nearest dollar)\nTherefore he will make $50\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.771639611572027, "len_probs": 145, "answer": "\nThe total revenue from marigolds is 12 pots x $2.74 = $32.\nThe total revenue from petunias is 9 pots x $1.87 = $16.93.\nThe total revenue from begonias is 17 pots x $2.12 = $35.04.\nThe total amount the three kinds of flowers would cost at the new price if rounded\nSo the total revenue would be $32 + $17\n= $50 (rounded to the nearest dollar)\nTherefore he will make $50\n#### 50\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total amount for all marigolds is 12 * $2.74 = $33.\nThe total amount for all petunias is 9 * $1.87 = $16.\nThe total amount for all begonias is 17 * $2.12 = $35.04.\nThe total amount is $33 + $16 + $35.04 = $84.04.\nArtie makes $84.04.
