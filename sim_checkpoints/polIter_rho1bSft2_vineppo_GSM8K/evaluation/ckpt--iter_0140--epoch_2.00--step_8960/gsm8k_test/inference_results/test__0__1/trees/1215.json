The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches.\nThe number of red jelly beans in the jar is .9*1.5\nThere are a total of 27 red jelly beans in the jar\nSo his guess was 900 - 27 = 873\nThe actual jar has a volume of 540\nSo his guess was 873 - 80\nSo the answer is 79%\n#### 873\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.534704390913248, "len_probs": 119, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches.\nThe number of red jelly beans in the jar is .9*1.5\nThere are a total of 27 red jelly beans in the jar\nSo his guess was 900 - 27 = 873\nThe actual jar has a volume of 540\nSo his guess was 873 - 80\nSo the answer is 79%\n#### 873\n"}, {"text": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches.\nThe volume of the jelly beans is .15*x,\nwhere x is the unknown number of jelly beans\nHe estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red, so .3*x\nHe guesses there are 900 red jelly beans, so .3*900 = 270 red jelly beans\nThe volume of the jelly beans he guessed is 270 * .03 = 81 cubic inches.\nThe difference between the guessed and actual volume is 540-81 = 469 cubic inches.\nTherefore the guess is 469/4 = 117.25\nHis guess was 117.25 off.\n#### 117\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.
