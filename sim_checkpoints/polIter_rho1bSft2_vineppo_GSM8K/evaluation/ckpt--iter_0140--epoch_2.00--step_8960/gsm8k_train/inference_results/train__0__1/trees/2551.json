15 = 25 packs of marbles.\nTherefore he kept everyone else\n#### the\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####\n####", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -24.227095410227776, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThere are a total of 400 marbles / 10 marble/pack = 40 packs of marbles in Leo's jar.\nHe gave Manny 1/4 * 40 = 10 packs of marbles.\nAnd he gave Neil 1/8 * 40 = 5 packs of marbles.\nThus total packs he gave away: 10 +5 = 15 packs of marbles.\nTherefore, he kept 40 -
