He wants to plant 2 apple trees that will be 10 feet wide each and need 12 feet between them.  The peach trees will be closer to the house and will grow to be 12 feet wide and will need 15 feet between each tree.  All told, how much space will these trees take up in his yard?\n\nSolution:\nThe apple trees will be 10 feet / 2 trees = 5 feet wide\nThe trees will need 12 feet / 4 spaces between trees\nSo they will be\n12 feet / 4 spaces = 3 feet apart\nSo the apple trees will be 5 + 3 = 8 feet\nThe peach trees will be 12 feet / 2 trees = 6 feet wide\nThe trees will need 15 feet / 2 spaces\nSo they will be\n15 feet / 2 spaces = 7.5 feet apart\nSo the peach trees will be 6 + 7.5 = 13.5 feet\nIn total, the apple trees will take up\n8 feet * 2 = 16 yards\nIn total, the peach trees will take up\n13.5 feet * 2 = 27 yards\nSo in total, all trees take up\n16 + 27 = 43 yards\n#### 43\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.65827503800392, "len_probs": 217, "answer": "\nThe apple trees will be 10 feet / 2 trees = 5 feet wide\nThe trees will need 12 feet / 4 spaces between trees\nSo they will be\n12 feet / 4 spaces = 3 feet apart\nSo the apple trees will be 5 + 3 = 8 feet\nThe peach trees will be 12 feet / 2 trees = 6 feet wide\nThe trees will need 15 feet / 2 spaces\nSo they will be\n15 feet / 2 spaces = 7.5 feet apart\nSo the peach trees will be 6 + 7.5 = 13.5 feet\nIn total, the apple trees will take up\n8 feet * 2 = 16 yards\nIn total, the peach trees will take up\n13.5 feet * 2 = 27 yards\nSo in total, all trees take up\n16 + 27 = 43 yards\n#### 43\n"}, {"text": "\nThe apple trees will be 10 feet x 2 = 20 feet wide\nThey will need a space between each tree so 1\nSo each set will be 1\nSo in all he will take a length of 2+2\nSo the total width = 20+1\n= 21 feet\nThe peach trees will be 12 feet x 2\nSo they will take a space of\n= 24\nIn total Quinton will take 2\nSo the total width = 21+24 = 45 feet\n#### 45\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nQuinton is looking to add 4 fruit trees to his backyard.
