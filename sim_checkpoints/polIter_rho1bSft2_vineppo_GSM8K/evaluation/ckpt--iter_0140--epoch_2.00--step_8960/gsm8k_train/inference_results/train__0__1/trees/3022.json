Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?\n\nSolution:\nBess throws a Frisbee 4 times, so she throws a total of 4 * 20 = 80 meters.\nBess throws it back 4 times * 5\nEach time she throws it back, it takes her 5 m\nShe throws it back a grand total of\n5 * (total back)\n5 * (4*20)\n5 * (80)\n400 meters\nThe total distance the Frisbees traveled is\n80 + 400 = 480 meters\n#### 480\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.708218656480312, "len_probs": 129, "answer": "\nBess throws a Frisbee 4 times, so she throws a total of 4 * 20 = 80 meters.\nBess throws it back 4 times * 5\nEach time she throws it back, it takes her 5 m\nShe throws it back a grand total of\n5 * (total back)\n5 * (4*20)\n5 * (80)\n400 meters\nThe total distance the Frisbees traveled is\n80 + 400 = 480 meters\n#### 480\n"}, {"text": "\nBess throws a Frisbee 4 times, so she throws a total of 4 * 20 = 80 meters.\nBess throws it back 4 times *\nSo it's back\nShe also leaves it behind every throw, so it's not added to the total distance.\nEach time Bess throws it, it travels the distance it can go, and then some.\nSo, the total distance for all throws is 80 +\nSo the answer is 80\n#### 80\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park.
