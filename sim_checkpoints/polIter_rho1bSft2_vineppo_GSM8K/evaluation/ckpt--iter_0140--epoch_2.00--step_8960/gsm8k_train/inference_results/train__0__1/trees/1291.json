All the candies cost $2.50 each. If the total cost of the candies is $200, how many grape candies does the store have?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of grape candies\ny is the number of cherry candles\nz is the number of apple candles\nWe know that the total cost of all the candles is 200 dollars\nThe equation is x + y + z = 200\nWe also know that the grape candles cost 2.5*y\nAnd the cherry candles cost 2.5*x\nAnd the apple candles cost 2.5*z\nSo we know that y + x + z = 40\nWe can now substitute 3y for x, 2.5x for y, and 4z for x\nSo the equations become:\n3y + 2.5x + z = 40\ny + x + z = 40\n3.5x + z = 40\nWe can now subtract the second equation from the first:\n2.5x + z = 40\n2.5x + z = 40\nAnd thus z = 40 - 2.5x\nSubstituting z in any of the original equations gives:\n3y + 2.5x = 65\n3y + 2.5x = 65\n3y + 2.5x = 65\n2y + x = 15\n2y + x = 15\nWe now have two equations with two variables. We can solve for x and y\n2.5x + z = 40\n2.5x + (40 - 2.5x) = 40\n2.5x + 40 - 2.5x = 40\n40 = 40\nThe solution is x = 40, y = 20, z = 10\nThe number of grape candies is 40\n#### 40\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -52.17005315423012, "len_probs": 420, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of grape candies\ny is the number of cherry candles\nz is the number of apple candles\nWe know that the total cost of all the candles is 200 dollars\nThe equation is x + y + z = 200\nWe also know that the grape candles cost 2.5*y\nAnd the cherry candles cost 2.5*x\nAnd the apple candles cost 2.5*z\nSo we know that y + x + z = 40\nWe can now substitute 3y for x, 2.5x for y, and 4z for x\nSo the equations become:\n3y + 2.5x + z = 40\ny + x + z = 40\n3.5x + z = 40\nWe can now subtract the second equation from the first:\n2.5x + z = 40\n2.5x + z = 40\nAnd thus z = 40 - 2.5x\nSubstituting z in any of the original equations gives:\n3y + 2.5x = 65\n3y + 2.5x = 65\n3y + 2.5x = 65\n2y + x = 15\n2y + x = 15\nWe now have two equations with two variables.
