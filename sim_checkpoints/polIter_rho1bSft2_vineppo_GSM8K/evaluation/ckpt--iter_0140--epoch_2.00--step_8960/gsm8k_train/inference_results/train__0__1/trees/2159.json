The first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.  The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor.  The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor.  And the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor.  How long, in feet, did the fourth competitor jump?\n\nSolution:\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, or 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, or 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet more than the third competitor, or 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nThus the final answer is 24 feet.
