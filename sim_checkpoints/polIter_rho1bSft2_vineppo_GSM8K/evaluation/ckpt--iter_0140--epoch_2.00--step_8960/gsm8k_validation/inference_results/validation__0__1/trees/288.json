She needs to fold the dough 4 times, which takes 5 minutes each time, then let it rest for 75 minutes each time. If mixing the ingredients takes 10 minutes and baking the croissants takes 30 minutes, how many hours does the whole process take?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we calculate the total time spent folding the dough. It takes 4 x 5 = 20 minutes\nThen we add the resting time, it takes another 4\nAnd the total time for folding and resting is 20\nSo we add another 4\n(4\n=\n20\n+\n4\n)\nAnd we calculate the final step\nWe calculate the total time spent so far: 11\nAnd it takes another 3\nSo we add that after all the other steps\n(11\n+\n3\n)= 14\nSo the total time it takes is 4\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -48.05011855810881, "len_probs": 144, "answer": "\nFirst, we calculate the total time spent folding the dough.
