The extra\nspeed 8\nis 85\nmiles per hour.\nAnother way to solve this problem is:\nThe difference in miles between the time driven\nat 45 miles per hour for hours\nat\n55 miles per hour for hours\nis 8\nhours\n* (45 miles/hour +\n55 miles/hour\n)\n= 8\nhours\n* 100 miles/hour\n= 800\nmiles\nthat she drove.\n8\nhours\n-\nthat she drove\n8\nhours\nat\n55\nmiles\n/\neach\nhour\n=\n8\nhours\n*\n55\nmiles\n/\neach\nhour\n=\n440\nmiles\nthat he drove\n800\n-\n440\n=\n360\nmiles\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\n85\nmiles\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nTamika\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nthat she drove\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nmore\nthan\nthat\nLogan\nis\ndriving\nat an average\nspeed\nof\nless\nthan\n80\nmiles/hour\nthat she drove\nthat she drove", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -118.5193942990154, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nTamika drove 8 x 45 = 360 miles at an average speed.\nLogan drove 5 x 55 = 275 miles at an average speed.\nThus, Tamika drove 360 - 275 = 85 miles less than Logan.\nTherefore, the answer is 85 miles (as the result).
