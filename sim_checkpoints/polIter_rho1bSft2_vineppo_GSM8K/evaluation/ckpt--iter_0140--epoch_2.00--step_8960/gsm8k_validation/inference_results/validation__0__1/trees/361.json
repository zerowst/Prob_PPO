He wants to buy 5 kilograms of apples, 3 packs of sugar, and 500 grams of walnuts. One kilogram of apples costs $2, and one kilogram of walnuts costs $6. One pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than one kilogram of apples. How much Fabian needs to pay for the items he wants to buy?\n\nSolution:\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar would cost $1 less each than $2 each, or $2 each, so 3 x $2 - $1\n= six\nFive hundred grams of walnuts would cost only $6 per kilogram, so\n500 grams x $6 = $300\nIn total all the items would cost\n$10 + $6\n= $16\nThere will be added\n$6 + $1\n= $7\nThere was found that Fabian needs to pay from the result above\n$3\nto get\n$16\n$16\n#### 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -52.50562457740307, "len_probs": 158, "answer": "\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar would cost $1 less each than $2 each, or $2 each, so 3 x $2 - $1\n= six\nFive hundred grams of walnuts would cost only $6 per kilogram, so\n500 grams x $6 = $300\nIn total all the items would cost\n$10 + $6\n= $16\nThere will be added\n$6 + $1\n= $7\nThere was found that Fabian needs to pay from the result above\n$3\nto get\n$16\n$16\n#### 16\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total amount for 5 kg of apples is: 5 kg x $2/kg = $10\nThe amount for each pack of sugar\n$2\nThe amount is\n5\npacks x $2/pack\n= $10\nAnd\n1\n$1 less\nSo the\n3\npacks of sugar will cost: 3 x $1/kg x\n$2\n= $6\nAnd he needs to pay the same amount as there are no other apples\nSo the total amount is: $10 + $6 + 500 gm\n= $10 + $6\n= 16\n#### 16\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nFabian is shopping at a nearby supermarket.
