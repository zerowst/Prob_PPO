She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\n\nSolution:\nThere are a total of 10 cars in the parking lot, and each of these cars has 4 wheels, so the total number of wheels for these 10 cars would be 10*4=40.\nDylan's parents' two cars each have 4 wheels, so they contribute 2*4=8 wheels.\nIncluding their two parents' cars in the total number of car wheels in the parking lot, there, therefore, is the 40 + 8 =\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -39.99483013525605, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThere are a total of 10 cars in the parking lot, and each of these cars has 4 wheels, so the total number of wheels for these 10 cars would be 10*4=40.\nDylan's parents' two cars each have 4 wheels, so they contribute 2*4=8 wheels.\nIncluding their two parents' cars in the total number of car wheels in the parking lot, there, therefore, is the 40 + 8 =\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n#### 48\n#### <\n#### 48\n"}, {"text": "\nThe guests arrive in 10 cars, and there are 4 wheels on each car, so the total number of wheels the guests' cars bring is 10*4=40.\nWe'll have to add the number of Dylan's parents' wheels to this total: 4\nThere's a good chance that the answer is already on your calculator, so you'll be able to answer this question without having to actually calculate.
