John would like to buy 15 packets of chips, and with the rest of the money he has left, buy as many packets of corn chips as he can. How many packets of corn chips could John buy if he has $45 for his entire purchase?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of 15 packets of chips at $2 per packet is 15 * $2 = $30.\nThe remaining amount of money he had after buying 15 packets of $2 chips\nis $45 - $30 = $15.\nThe $15 is the money left after buying\neach packet of $1.5 chips\nthat he could have sold in the $3\nthat he just received. So the money he spends for the\n15 packets of chips\nis $15 / $1.5 per = 10 packets of chips.\nSo John could buy $45 - $3 (for 3 packets\nthat he already spent\n$2 each\nthat he bought at\n$4\nthat he bought\nthat he bought\nthat he bought\nfor\n$3\nas they are worth more than his remaining money\nthat is left after he bought chips\nthat he bought\nthe rest\nin this case he spent all his money\nthat is\n$45\nand he bought 10 packets\nthat cost\n$10.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -101.98991953581572, "len_probs": 251, "answer": "\nThe total cost of 15 packets of chips at $2 per packet is 15 * $2 = $30.\nThe remaining amount of money he had after buying 15 packets of $2 chips\nis $45 - $30 = $15.\nThe $15 is the money left after buying\neach packet of $1.5 chips\nthat he could have sold in the $3\nthat he just received.
