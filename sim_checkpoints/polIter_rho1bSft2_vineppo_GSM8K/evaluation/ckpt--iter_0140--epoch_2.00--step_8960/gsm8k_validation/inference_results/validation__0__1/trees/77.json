There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nLet $m$ be the number of machines in the launderette. Each machine holds $80q$ quarters and $100d$ dimes. The total amount of money in each machine is $80q+100d$.\nThus, the total amount of money in all machines is $80q\\cdot 80+100d\\cdot 100$.\nThis simplifies to $9(80q+100d)=9000$.\nDividing through by 10, we get $9(80q+100d)=900$.\nDividing through by 9, we get $80q+100d=1000$.\nDividing through by 10, we get $8q+10d=100$.\nDividing through by 2, we get $4q+5d=50$.\nLet $c$ be the number of machines\n$c\\cdot 4q+c\\cdot 5d=c(4q+5d)=50c$.\nThus, $c$ is determined by $50c=1000-4q-5d$.\nSince $c$ must be a whole number, $50$ is not a factor of $1000-4q-5d$.\nThus, there must be no solution to this equation.\nTherefore the answer is $0$ machines.\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.773739501833916, "len_probs": 336, "answer": "\nLet $m$ be the number of machines in the launderette.
