The rows are 120 feet long, and each seed needs its own dedicated space of 18 inches to its right. How many seeds can Bob plant in each row?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how many inches one row is by adding up the space for two seeds that are each 18 inches:\n18 inches * 2 = 36 inches\nSo, there\u2019s a total of 120 feet / 36 inches = 3 rows of seeds.\nThus, Bob can plant each of his corn rows with at most 3 18-inch spaces, which won\u2019t allow for a single space for another plant, so in this way, he can only plant 3 of those spaces, one for each row.\n#### the\n#### 3\n####\n</span>\n#### 3\n####\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.36760139465332, "len_probs": 144, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how many inches one row is by adding up the space for two seeds that are each 18 inches:\n18 inches * 2 = 36 inches\nSo, there\u2019s a total of 120 feet / 36 inches = 3 rows of seeds.\nThus, Bob can plant each of his corn rows with at most 3 18-inch spaces, which won\u2019t allow for a single space for another plant, so in this way, he can only plant 3 of those spaces, one for each row.\n#### the\n#### 3\n####\n</span>\n#### 3\n####\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the rows into inches since the seeds need a space that is measured in inches.
