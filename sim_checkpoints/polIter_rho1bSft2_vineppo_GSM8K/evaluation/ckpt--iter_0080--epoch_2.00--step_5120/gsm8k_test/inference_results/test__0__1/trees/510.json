Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are left until his birthday. December 31st is 31 days after December 31st.\nNext, we subtract that amount from the total number of days in a year to determine how many days are left until his birthday. 365 days (a year) - 31 days (his birthday) = 15 days\nNow we divide the number of lbs he needs to lose by the number of days to determine how many calories he needs to burn per day to reach his goal. 30 lbs / 15 days = 2 lbs per day.\nNext, we divide the number of calories per day he needs to burn by the calories he consumes per day to determine the net calorie deficit per day. 3500 calories / 1 calorie per day = 3500 calories per day.\nFinally, we divide the number of calories he needs to burn per day by the number of calories he consumes per day to determine the net calorie deficit per day. 2 lbs per day / 1 calorie per day = 2 net calories per day.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.493096992373466, "len_probs": 269, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are left until his birthday.
