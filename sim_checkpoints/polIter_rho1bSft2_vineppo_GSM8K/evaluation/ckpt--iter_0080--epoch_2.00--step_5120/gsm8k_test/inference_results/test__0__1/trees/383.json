She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie spent $18 to buy supplies for her lemonade stand.\nShe makes 1 cup of lemonade per hour, so she can make 4 cups of lemonade per hour that her lemonade stand is open.\nTherefore, she can make 4 * $1 = $4 in sales per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.\nTherefore, Millie\u2019s profit per hour from selling all of her lemonade is $4 - $18 (her initial cost) = -$14\nMillie would make a profit of -$14 per hour running her lemonade stand.\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.666250936686993, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nMillie spent $18 to buy supplies for her lemonade stand.\nShe makes 1 cup of lemonade per hour, so she can make 4 cups of lemonade per hour that her lemonade stand is open.\nTherefore, she can make 4 * $1 = $4 in sales per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.\nTherefore, Millie\u2019s profit per hour from selling all of her lemonade is $4 - $18 (her initial cost) = -$14\nMillie would make a profit of -$14 per hour running her lemonade stand.\n#### 14\n"}, {"text": "\nMillie spent $18 to buy supplies for her lemonade stand.\nShe makes 1 cup of lemonade per hour that she opens her lemonade stand, so she makes 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open.\nEach pitcher of lemonade makes 12 cups, so Millie makes a total of 3*12=36 cups of lemonade.\nIf she sells all of the lemonade, she makes a total of 36*1=$36.\nHer profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is $36 (her total profit of $0 from the lemonade stand) divided by the number of hours she runs her lemonade stand, which is 1.
