This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. How many apples did he bring home?\nHe brought home 2 apples that he put in his pocket and 1 that he threw away because he was picking up the other one, so 2 + 1 = 3 apples.\nThen 6 more fell out of the tree because 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 apples fell out of the tree in all.\nHe brought home 2 + the 3 apples that were left = 2 + 3 = 5 apples.\n#### 5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTwo apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.
