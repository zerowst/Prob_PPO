She also walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, to Hollock valley shores. Calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes.\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, she walked for 8*60 = 480 minutes.\nOn the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is 480/2 = 240 minutes.\nShe also walked 240 miles in 240-minute intervals.\nThe total time she walked in the two days is 480+240 = 720 minutes\nYou can find the total time in hours by dividing by 60, so 720 minutes is 720/60 = 12 hours.\nThe total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 12 hours.\nIn the 2 days, Sandy walked 12 hours * 2 (days), so she traveled in total 24 miles (as 1 hour * 60 minutes / 2 = 60 minutes / 2, so 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes per mile * 2 miles).\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.115026745945215, "len_probs": 256, "answer": "\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
