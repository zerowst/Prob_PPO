He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raised the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is therefore 40+15=55 degrees.\nAfter 30 minutes of window open, the temperature dropped by 2*0.5=1 degree.\nThe temperature after the window was open was 55-1=54 degrees.\nThe temperature after a 30-minute window was open was 54-2(0.5)=51 degrees.\n#### 51\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.97644393146038, "len_probs": 124, "answer": "\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raised the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is therefore 40+15=55 degrees.\nAfter 30 minutes of window open, the temperature dropped by 2*0.5=1 degree.\nThe temperature after the window was open was 55-1=54 degrees.\nThe temperature after a 30-minute window was open was 54-2(0.5)=51 degrees.\n#### 51\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter 3 hours, the oven raised the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nSo the temperature after 3 hours was 40+15=55 degrees.\nThe house cooled down 30 minutes, or 1/2*2=1 hour.\nSo the temperature after he opened the window was 55-2(1)=51 degrees.\nThen the temperature in the house after 30 minutes of open window was 51-5(1/2*10)=51-25=26 degrees.\nSo the final temperature is the 26.\n#### 26\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
