How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times * 25 kilometers/time = 125 kilometers per week.\nSo, in 4 weeks he rode 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times * 60 kilometers/time = 120 kilometers per week.\nSo, in 3 weeks he rode 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.\nThe total of the two amounts is 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.\nThat\u2019s it for now, I will keep this page updated with the new information I get.\n#### 860\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.486240603029728, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times * 25 kilometers/time = 125 kilometers per week.\nSo, in 4 weeks he rode 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times * 60 kilometers/time = 120 kilometers per week.\nSo, in 3 weeks he rode 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.\nThe total of the two amounts is 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.\nThat\u2019s it for now, I will keep this page updated with the new information I get.\n#### 860\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first four weeks, he rode the bike 4 weeks * 5 times/week * 25 km/time = 500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, he rode the bike 3 weeks * 2 times/week * 60 km/time = 1080 kilometers.\nSo in total, Micheal rode 500 + 1080 = 1580 kilometers.\nThat's because 500 + 1080 = 1580.\nThat's because 500 + (3 weeks * 2 times/week * 60 km/time) = 1580.\nSo the answer is 1580.\n#### 1580\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMicheal loves riding a bike.
