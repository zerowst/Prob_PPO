A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.\n\nSolution:\nOn Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 5 * 2 = 10 articles.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote 2 * 10 = 20 articles.\nSo, the total number of articles she wrote from Monday to Wednesday is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 articles.\nHence, the total number of hours she spent writing 5 articles on Monday is 4 * 5 = 20 hours.\nThus her total writing hours for the three days is 20 + 2 * 4 (the hours for 2 Tuesday articles) + 4 * 5 (the hours for 5 articles on Wednesday) = 20 + 8 + 20 = 48\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.789451584219933, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nOn Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 5 * 2 = 10 articles.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote 2 * 10 = 20 articles.\nSo, the total number of articles she wrote from Monday to Wednesday is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 articles.\nHence, the total number of hours she spent writing 5 articles on Monday is 4 * 5 = 20 hours.\nThus her total writing hours for the three days is 20 + 2 * 4 (the hours for 2 Tuesday articles) + 4 * 5 (the hours for 5 articles on Wednesday) = 20 + 8 + 20 = 48\n#### 48\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 * 5 articles on Monday = 2 * 5 = 10 articles.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote 10 * 2 = 20 articles.\nSo, the total number of articles she wrote from Monday to Wednesday is 5 articles on Monday + 10 articles on Tuesday + 20 articles on Wednesday = 35 articles.\nThus, she wrote 5 articles on Monday, 3 days * 10 articles on Tuesday = 30 articles on Tuesday, and 2 days * 20 articles on Wednesday = 40 articles on Wednesday\nThe total number of articles she wrote in the three days is 35 articles.\nThe total time she spent writing these articles is 4 hours/article * 35 articles = 140 hours\n#### 140\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.
