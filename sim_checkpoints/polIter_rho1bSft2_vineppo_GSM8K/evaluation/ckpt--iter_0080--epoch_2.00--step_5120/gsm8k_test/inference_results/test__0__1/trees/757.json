Six more students need size extra-large than large.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?\n\nSolution:\nExtra small = 11\nSmall = 2 * extra small = 2 * 11 = 22\nMedium = 2 * (size small) = 2 * 22 = 44\nLarge = (size medium - 4) = (44 - 4) = 40\nExtra-large = 6 + size extra-large = 6 + 11 = 17\nAltogether, the shirts are 11 + 22 + 44 + 40 + 17 = 132\nShe ordered 132\n#### 132\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.45562794804573, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nExtra small = 11\nSmall = 2 * extra small = 2 * 11 = 22\nMedium = 2 * (size small) = 2 * 22 = 44\nLarge = (size medium - 4) = (44 - 4) = 40\nExtra-large = 6 + size extra-large = 6 + 11 = 17\nAltogether, the shirts are 11 + 22 + 44 + 40 + 17 = 132\nShe ordered 132\n#### 132\n"}]}
