The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nThat means it can hold 540*.15=81 cubic inches of jelly beans\nThat means he could fit 81/0.8=100 red jelly beans in there\nSo his guess was 900-100=800\nThat means he was 800/81=10.08\nSo he was 10.08 away from the true answer\n#### 10.08\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.814752645790577, "len_probs": 129, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nThat means it can hold 540*.15=81 cubic inches of jelly beans\nThat means he could fit 81/0.8=100 red jelly beans in there\nSo his guess was 900-100=800\nThat means he was 800/81=10.08\nSo he was 10.08 away from the true answer\n#### 10.08\n"}]}
