How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nKim woke up at 6 a.m. + 5 minutes = 6:05 a.m.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so she was asleep for 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes after 2:15 am\nShe slept 6:05 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3:10 a.m.\nTherefore, she slept 3:10 a.m. - (2:38 a.m. + 5 minutes) = 3:10 a.m. - 2:43 a.m. = 27 minutes\n#### 27\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.182104840874672, "len_probs": 172, "answer": "\nKim woke up at 6 a.m. + 5 minutes = 6:05 a.m.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so she was asleep for 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes after 2:15 am\nShe slept 6:05 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3:10 a.m.\nTherefore, she slept 3:10 a.m. - (2:38 a.m. + 5 minutes) = 3:10 a.m. - 2:43 a.m. = 27 minutes\n#### 27\n"}, {"text": "\nKim woke up at 6 a.m. and went to sleep at 10 p.m. so she usually sleeps 10-6 = 4 hours\nThat day she slept 4 hours and 38-2(her usual wake time) = 5 minutes less\nThat means she slept 4+5/60 = 4.8333333333333335 hours\nSo she slept 4.8333333333333335*60 = 289.99999999999997\nShe slept for 290 minutes that day because 289.99999999999997 is not an integer\n#### 290\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room.
