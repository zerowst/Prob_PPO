It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?\n\nSolution:\nBilly has to peel and cut 60 potatoes, so he has to do 60 peelings and 60 cuts.\nThe peelings will take 60 * 1.5 = 90 seconds, because there are 60 seconds in a minute.\nThe cuts will take 60 * 5 = 300 seconds, because there are 60 seconds in a second and he cuts them in 5 seconds each.\nSo Billy will have to spend 90 + 300 = 390 seconds doing this, because that's how long it takes him to do 60 of something.\nThat's the time Billy has to spend, so he'll spend it.\nHis final time will be 390 seconds, because that's how long he has to do this for his task.\n#### 390\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.61842871457338, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nBilly has to peel and cut 60 potatoes, so he has to do 60 peelings and 60 cuts.\nThe peelings will take 60 * 1.5 = 90 seconds, because there are 60 seconds in a minute.\nThe cuts will take 60 * 5 = 300 seconds, because there are 60 seconds in a second and he cuts them in 5 seconds each.\nSo Billy will have to spend 90 + 300 = 390 seconds doing this, because that's how long it takes him to do 60 of something.\nThat's the time Billy has to spend, so he'll spend it.\nHis final time will be 390 seconds, because that's how long he has to do this for his task.\n#### 390\n"}, {"text": "\nBilly has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
