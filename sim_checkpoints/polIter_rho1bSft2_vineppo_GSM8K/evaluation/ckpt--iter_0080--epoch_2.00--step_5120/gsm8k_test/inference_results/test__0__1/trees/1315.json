If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?\n\nSolution:\nAna spends 3 minutes per orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes per orange. Together they spend 3 + 4 = 7 minutes per orange.\nAn hour is 60 minutes, so if they pick at the same time, Ana will peel 60 / 7 * (the number of oranges she has left) more oranges than Jane.\nLet x be the number of oranges Ana has left after an hour.\nThe equation (60 / 7) * (x) = the number of oranges left after an hour that Ana has peeled more than Jane is (60 / 7) * (the number of oranges Ana has left after an hour).\nThis equation can be rewritten as 60x / 7 = the number of oranges left after an hour.\nSubtracting the number of oranges Jane has left from the number of oranges Ana has left after an hour, we get the number of more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane: (60x / 7) - (x)\nThis can be simplified to 60x - 7x / 7 = the number of more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane.\nThe final answer is the number of more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane: (60x - 7x) / 7\nThis simplifies to 53x / 7, so the answer is 53.\n#### 53\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.96403057873249, "len_probs": 324, "answer": "\nAna spends 3 minutes per orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes per orange.
