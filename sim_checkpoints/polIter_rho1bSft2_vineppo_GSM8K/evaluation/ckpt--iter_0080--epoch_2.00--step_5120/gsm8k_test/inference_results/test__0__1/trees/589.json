If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. What will be the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Martin loses or gains per week. We start by subtracting the weight loss from the weight gain for each breakfast option:\n-For breakfast, Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week and gains 1.75 pounds/week, so he gains 1.75 - 1.25 = 0.5 pounds/week.\n\nNow we will multiply this difference in weight gain/loss per week by the number of weeks in 5 weeks to find the total difference in weight:\n0.5 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 2.5 pounds\nMartin's weight at the end of 5 weeks will be 2.5 pounds more than his weight at the start of 5 weeks.\n#### 2.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.797389432787895, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Martin loses or gains per week.
