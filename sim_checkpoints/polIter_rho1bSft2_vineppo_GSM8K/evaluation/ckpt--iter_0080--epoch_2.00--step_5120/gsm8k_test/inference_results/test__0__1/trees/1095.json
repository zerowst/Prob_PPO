between the two trains after 3 hours.\nSo they are 450 miles apart.\nThat\u2019s the distance between them.\nSo the answer is 450 miles.\n#### 450\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIf two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other after 3 hours?\n\nSolution:\nThe first train is traveling 60 miles an hour, so after 3 hours it will travel 60*3 = 180 miles.\nThe second train is traveling half the distance of the first train, so it's 180/2=90 miles per hour.\nAfter 3 hours the second train will travel 90*3 = 270 miles.\nThe first train and the second train are traveling in opposite directions so we need to add their distances to find the total distance between them.\nSo the total distance is 180+270= 450 miles.\nThere are 450 miles between the two trains after 3 hours.\nSo they are 450 miles apart.\nThat\u2019s the distance between them.\nSo the answer is 450 miles.\n#### 450\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.11272931843996, "len_probs": 194, "answer": "\nThe first train is
