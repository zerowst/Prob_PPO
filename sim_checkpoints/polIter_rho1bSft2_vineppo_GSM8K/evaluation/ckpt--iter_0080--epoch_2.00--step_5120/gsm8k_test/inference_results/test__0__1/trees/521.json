How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday night, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nOn Tuesday night, Chris completed 36 problems, leaving 100 - (12 + 36) = 30 problems.\nOn Wednesday, he completed 1/4 of the remaining problems, so he completed 1/4 * 30 = 7 problems.\nOn Wednesday night, Chris completed 7 problems, leaving 30 - 7 = 23 problems.\nThus, on Thursday night, Chris had 23 problems to complete.\nThus, Chris\u2019s final math homework number is 23.\n#### 23\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.912172488868237, "len_probs": 183, "answer": "\nOn Monday night, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nOn Tuesday night, Chris completed 36 problems, leaving 100 - (12 + 36) = 30 problems.\nOn Wednesday, he completed 1/4 of the remaining problems, so he completed 1/4 * 30 = 7 problems.\nOn Wednesday night, Chris completed 7 problems, leaving 30 - 7 = 23 problems.\nThus, on Thursday night, Chris had 23 problems to complete.\nThus, Chris\u2019s final math homework number is 23.\n#### 23\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Monday night, he completes 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completes 3*12 = 36 problems\nOn Tuesday, he completes 36 problems, so he has 100-36 = 64 problems left\nOn Wednesday, he completes 1/4 of the remaining problems, so he has left 64*(1/4) = 16 more problems to complete.\nThus, he still has to complete 64-16 = 48 problems on Thursday.\n#### 48\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nChris is way behind on his math homework.
