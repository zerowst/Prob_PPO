Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?\n\nSolution:\nThe total time for the swim was 40 minutes. If it takes 10% less time for James, then 10% of 40 minutes is (10/100)*40 = 4 minutes.\nSo the total time for the swim is 40 minus 4 minutes = 36 minutes.\nThe bike ride took 1 hour and 20 minutes, so it is 60 + 20 = 80 minutes.\nThe total time for the bike ride is 80 minus 5 minutes, so 80 minus 5 is 75 minutes.\nThe total time for the run was 50 minutes.\nThe total for all three parts of the run is 36 minutes + 75 minutes = 111 minutes\nIf the total time for the run was 111 minutes and Jon won by 10 minutes, then he must have taken 111-10=101 minutes for the run.\n#### 101\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.79180770367384, "len_probs": 228, "answer": "\nThe total time for the swim was 40 minutes.
