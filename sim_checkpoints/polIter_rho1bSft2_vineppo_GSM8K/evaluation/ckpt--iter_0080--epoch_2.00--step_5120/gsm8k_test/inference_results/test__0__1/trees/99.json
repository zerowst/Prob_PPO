Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?\n\nSolution:\nMary already has 2 potted plants * 40 window ledges = 80 potted plants.\nShe gave 1 potted plant * each of 40 window ledges = 40 potted plants\nShe will remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants.\nHence, she will remain with 40 after she gives 1 potted plant to each window ledge.\nTherefore, she will remain with 40 potted plants (after giving 1 potted plant to each window ledge)\nThis is because she will be left with the 40 she already had after giving 1 potted plant to each window ledge.\nIt is also from this that she gave away 40.\nShe was left with 40 potted plants.\n#### 40\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -50.540094926953316, "len_probs": 184, "answer": "\nMary already has 2 potted plants * 40 window ledges = 80 potted plants.\nShe gave 1 potted plant * each of 40 window ledges = 40 potted plants\nShe will remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants.\nHence, she will remain with 40 after she gives 1 potted plant to each window ledge.\nTherefore, she will remain with 40 potted plants (after giving 1 potted plant to each window ledge)\nThis is because she will be left with the 40 she already had after giving 1 potted plant to each window ledge.\nIt is also from this that she gave away 40.\nShe was left with 40 potted plants.\n#### 40\n"}]}
