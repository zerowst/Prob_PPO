If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total cost of the asphalt buckets: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75.\nThen add the cost of the fine to find the total cost: $75 + $120 = $195.\nThen subtract the cost of the asphalt from the total cost to find Ron's savings: $195 - $100 (the cost of fixing it himself) = $95.\nSo Ron saves $95 by fixing the pothole.\n#### 95\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.774552956223488, "len_probs": 122, "answer": "\nFirst find the total cost of the asphalt buckets: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75.\nThen add the cost of the fine to find the total cost: $75 + $120 = $195.\nThen subtract the cost of the asphalt from the total cost to find Ron's savings: $195 - $100 (the cost of fixing it himself) = $95.\nSo Ron saves $95 by fixing the pothole.\n#### 95\n"}]}
