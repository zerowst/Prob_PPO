How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total cost to make 1 jar of the mix: $6 + $8 + $10 = $24\nThen find the total cost to make 10 jars: $24/jar * 10 jars = $240\nThen find the total cost of the passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey: $2(2 + 1.5) + $2(2) + $2(24) = $2(4.5) + $2(2) + $2(24) = $9 + $4 + $48 = $61\nThen find the total profit from selling 10 jars: $50/jar * 10 jars - $61 = $500 - $61 = $439\n#### 439\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -10.312301218509674, "len_probs": 187, "answer": "\nFirst find the total cost to make 1 jar of the mix: $6 + $8 + $10 = $24\nThen find the total cost to make 10 jars: $24/jar * 10 jars = $240\nThen find the total cost of the passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey: $2(2 + 1.5) + $2(2) + $2(24) = $2(4.5) + $2(2) + $2(24) = $9 + $4 + $48 = $61\nThen find the total profit from selling 10 jars: $50/jar * 10 jars - $61 = $500 - $61 = $439\n#### 439\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the total cost to make 1 jar of mix: $6 + $8 + $10 = $24\nThen find the total cost to make 10 jars: $24/jar * 10 jars = $240\nThen find the total cost of the passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey: $2(2*10) + $1.5(1.5*10) + $2(2*10) = $240\nThen find the total profit from selling 10 jars: $10/jar * 10 jars = $100\nThen subtract the total cost from the total profit to find the profit: $100 - $240 = -$140\n#### 140\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim makes a special honey and jam mix.
