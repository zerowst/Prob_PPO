What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?\n\nSolution:\nWhen Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his dad. His dad is currently 24 years + 19 years = 43 years old.\nSo, when Emil is 24, his dad will be 43 + (19 years) = 62 years old.\nEmil is currently half as old as his dad, so his dad is 2 * Emil's age.\nThis means 2 * Emil's age = 62 years old + 19 years, which is his dad's age.\nSo, 2 * Emil's age = 62 + 19\nThis gives 2 * Emil's age = 81\nEmil's age = 81 / 2 = 40.5 years old.\nHis dad is currently 40.5 + 19 = 60.5 years old.\nTheir combined age is 60.5 + 40.5 = 101 years.\n#### 101\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.41106928139925, "len_probs": 239, "answer": "\nWhen Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his dad.
