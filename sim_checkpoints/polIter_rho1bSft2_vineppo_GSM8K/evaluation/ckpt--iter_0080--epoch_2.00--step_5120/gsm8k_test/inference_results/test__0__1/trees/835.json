hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.\nIf each kangaroo is traveling at half the speed of a turtle, then the total speed of the turtles is 6 hours * (1 + half the speed of a kangaroo).\nThat means each turtle is traveling at 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours per kangaroo.\nIf it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel, then one kangaroo can travel 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.\nTherefore, if there were four turtles, they could travel the 18 hours in 18 hours / (3 hours per kangaroo + (3 hours per kangaroo / 2)) = 18 hours / (4.5 hours per kangaroo)\n= 4
