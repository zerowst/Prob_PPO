Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?\n\nSolution:\nBernadette\u2019s drive takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s, so it takes 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes to drive from her apartment to the theater.\nThe total time for Wayne to get to the theater is 4 + the time it takes Bernadette\u2019s drive to get there, so 4 + 16 = 20 minutes\nBernadette should leave five minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first, so she should leave now to be first.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.182647451758385, "len_probs": 119, "answer": "\nBernadette\u2019s drive takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s, so it takes 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes to drive from her apartment to the theater.\nThe total time for Wayne to get to the theater is 4 + the time it takes Bernadette\u2019s drive to get there, so 4 + 16 = 20 minutes\nBernadette should leave five minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first, so she should leave now to be first.\n#### 5\n"}]}
