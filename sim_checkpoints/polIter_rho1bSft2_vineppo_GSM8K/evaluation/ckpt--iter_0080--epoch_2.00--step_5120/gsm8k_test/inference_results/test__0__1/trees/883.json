If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the usual duration of Elaina\u2019s concert. We know that her final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert was 2*x.\nThe final concert and the encore together lasted 65 minutes, so they ran for 65 minutes in total. If we add the duration of the 15-minute encore, we get 65, which means:\n2*x + 15 = 65\nWe can now solve for x:\n2*x = 65 - 15\n2*x = 50\nx = 50 / 2\nx = 25, so the usual duration of Elaina\u2019s concert was 25 minutes.\n#### 25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.025934524834156, "len_probs": 169, "answer": "\nLet x be the usual duration of Elaina\u2019s concert.
