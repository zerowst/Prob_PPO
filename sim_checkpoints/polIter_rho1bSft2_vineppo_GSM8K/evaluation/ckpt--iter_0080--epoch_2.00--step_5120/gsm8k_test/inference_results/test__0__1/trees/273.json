The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?\n\nSolution:\nThe collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches to complete.\nThe rosette takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches to complete.\nThe sleeves take 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 50 stitches\nSo each sleeve takes 50 / 2 = 25 stitches after the first\n#### 25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.99776514619589, "len_probs": 109, "answer": "\nThe collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches to complete.\nThe rosette takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches to complete.\nThe sleeves take 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 50 stitches\nSo each sleeve takes 50 / 2 = 25 stitches after the first\n#### 25\n"}]}
