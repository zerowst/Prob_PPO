They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 2 * 100 * 0.5 (since there are 2 of them and they run back and forth) = 2250\nKelly ran 15 times, but then she changed her mind and ran 34 times to the 40-yard line, so she ran 34 * 2 * 100 * 0.5 = 620\nSo the winner ran 2250 - 620 = 1630 yards more than the loser\n#### 1630\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.128438711166382, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nBlake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 2 * 100 * 0.5 (since there are 2 of them and they run back and forth) = 2250\nKelly ran 15 times, but then she changed her mind and ran 34 times to the 40-yard line, so she ran 34 * 2 * 100 * 0.5 = 620\nSo the winner ran 2250 - 620 = 1630 yards more than the loser\n#### 1630\n"}, {"text": "\nBlake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 2 * 100 = 3,000 yards\nKelly ran back and forth once, so she ran 1 * 100 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1,000\nKelly also ran to the 40-yard line 34 times, so she ran 34 * 40 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 34\nThe winner ran 3,000 + 1,000 = 4,000 yards\nThe loser ran 3,000 + 34 = 3,034 yards\nThe winner ran 4,000 - 3,034 = 966 yards\n#### 966\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBlake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes.
