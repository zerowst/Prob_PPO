One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne apple costs 0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana is 0.5 x 2 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 x the price of one banana, so one orange is 3 x 1 = $3.\nThus, a crate of fruit consists of 5 + 12 + 7 = 24 pieces of fruit,\nThe total cost for these pieces is 24 (5 x 0.5 + 12 x 1 + 7 x 3)\nThe total cost for these pieces is 24(5+12+7)/24\nThe total cost for these pieces is 24(24)\nThe total cost for these pieces is 144\nSo the answer is 144.\n#### 144\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.728262521326542, "len_probs": 198, "answer": "\nOne apple costs 0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana is 0.5 x 2 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 x the price of one banana, so one orange is 3 x 1 = $3.\nThus, a crate of fruit consists of 5 + 12 + 7 = 24 pieces of fruit,\nThe total cost for these pieces is 24 (5 x 0.5 + 12 x 1 + 7 x 3)\nThe total cost for these pieces is 24(5+12+7)/24\nThe total cost for these pieces is 24(24)\nThe total cost for these pieces is 144\nSo the answer is 144.\n#### 144\n"}, {"text": "\nOne crate of bananas costs 5 x 2 = $10.\nOne crate of oranges costs 1 x 3 = $3 for each piece.\nSo, the price of 12 apples is 12 x 0.5 = $6.\nAnd, the price of 7 oranges is 7 x 3 = $21.\nSo the total price of a crate is 6 + (3 x 12) + 21 = $6 + 36 + 21 = $63.\nHence, the total cost of a crate is $63.\nThe company sells the fruit in crates of 1.\nSo, the total cost of a crate of fruit would be $63.\nThus, the cost of a crate of fruit is $63.\nThe company sells the fruit in crates of 1.\nSo, the total cost of a crate of fruit would be $63.\n#### 63\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
