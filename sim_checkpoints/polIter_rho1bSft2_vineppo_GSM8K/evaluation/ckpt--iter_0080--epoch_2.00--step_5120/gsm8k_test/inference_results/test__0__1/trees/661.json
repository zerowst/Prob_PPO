The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?\n\nSolution:\nThe normal brand of coffee cost $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand was 20% more, so the more expensive brand cost 5 + (20/100)*5 = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\nRoger buys a week's worth of coffee, so he needs to buy 7 * 1 = 7 pounds of coffee.\nThus, he pays 7 * $6 = $42 for the more expensive brand of coffee.\nHe also buys himself a donut for $2.\nThus in total Roger pays $2 + $42 = $44.\n#### 44\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.376421719789505, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nThe normal brand of coffee cost $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand was 20% more, so the more expensive brand cost 5 + (20/100)*5 = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\nRoger buys a week's worth of coffee, so he needs to buy 7 * 1 = 7 pounds of coffee.\nThus, he pays 7 * $6 = $42 for the more expensive brand of coffee.\nHe also buys himself a donut for $2.\nThus in total Roger pays $2 + $42 = $44.\n#### 44\n"}, {"text": "\nThe more expensive brand of coffee cost 5*0.2=$1 more than the normal brand\nSo the more expensive coffee was 5+1=$6 per pound.\nHe bought 1 pound of coffee per day, so in a week he would have bought 7*1=7 pounds.\nThat would cost 7*6=$42 for the more expensive brand.\nThe normal brand was $5 per pound so for 7 pounds he paid 7*5=$35.\nThe total cost for both brands was $42++$35=$77.\nAnd he also bought himself a donut for $2, so in total he paid $77+$2=$79.\n#### 79\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRoger goes to the store to buy some coffee.
