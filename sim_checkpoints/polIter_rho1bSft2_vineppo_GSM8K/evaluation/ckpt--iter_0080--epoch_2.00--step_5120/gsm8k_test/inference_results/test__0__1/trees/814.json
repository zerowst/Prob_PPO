Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?\n\nSolution:\nJack is playing with 3 friends, so they can play for a total of 3 * (1 quarter for 20 minutes) = 3 * (20 * (1/2)) = 3 * (10) = 30 minutes\nTwo of his friends are significantly worse than him, so they can only play for (1/2) * 30 = 15 minutes each\nOne of his friends is significantly better than him, so he can play for 1.5 * 30 = 45 minutes\nThey play for 4 hours, so they spend 4 * (60) minutes in total = 240 minutes\nThe money he uses is 240 minutes * (1 quarter for 20 minutes) = 240 * (1/2) = 120 dollars\n#### 120\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.764205895364285, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nJack is playing with 3 friends, so they can play for a total of 3 * (1 quarter for 20 minutes) = 3 * (20 * (1/2)) = 3 * (10) = 30 minutes\nTwo of his friends are significantly worse than him, so they can only play for (1/2) * 30 = 15 minutes each\nOne of his friends is significantly better than him, so he can play for 1.5 * 30 = 45 minutes\nThey play for 4 hours, so they spend 4 * (60) minutes in total = 240 minutes\nThe money he uses is 240 minutes * (1 quarter for 20 minutes) = 240 * (1/2) = 120 dollars\n#### 120\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 3 friends and they each play for 20*2=40 minutes\nSo they play for 3*40=120 minutes\nThey are playing for 4 hours and 40 minutes so that\u2019s 4*60+40=280\nThey are playing for 120 minutes so that\u2019s 3*20 because one of the friends is significantly better\nThey are playing for 120 so 3*20 is 180\nSo in total they used 180+20(from the other two) = 200\n#### 200\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.
