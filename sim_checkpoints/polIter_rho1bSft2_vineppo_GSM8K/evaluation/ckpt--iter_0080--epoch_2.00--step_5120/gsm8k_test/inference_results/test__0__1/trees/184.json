rolled.\nThe probability of rolling a 3 is 1/6 because there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.\nThe probability of rolling an even number in a row is 3/6 because there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\nThe probability of rolling a 3 followed by an even number is 1/6 * 3/6 because we multiply the probabilities of each individual event (rolling a 3 and then rolling an even number).\nThe probability of rolling a 3 followed by an even number is 1/6 * 3/6 because we multiply the probabilities of each individual event (rolling a 3 and then rolling an even number).\nThe probability of rolling a 3 followed by an even number is 1/6 * 3/6 because we multiply the probabilities of each individual event (rolling a 3 and then rolling an
