She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?\n\nSolution:\nEllen started with 12 sodas - 3 shaken, 1 unshaken.\nShe took 1 soda for herself, leaving 12-3-1=8 sodas.\nHer brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken, leaving 8-1-2=5 shaken soda.\nHer friend took 1 of the 5 shaken soda, so there is a 1/5 chance of getting a shaken soda.\nNow we need to multiply that by the probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda from that, which is 1/8 * (1/5) = (1*5)/(8*5) = 1/4\nSo the answer is 1/4 = 25%\n#### 25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.962628848850727, "len_probs": 182, "answer": "\nEllen started with 12 sodas - 3 shaken, 1 unshaken.\nShe took 1 soda for herself, leaving 12-3-1=8 sodas.\nHer brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken, leaving 8-1-2=5 shaken soda.\nHer friend took 1 of the 5 shaken soda, so there is a 1/5 chance of getting a shaken soda.\nNow we need to multiply that by the probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda from that, which is 1/8 * (1/5) = (1*5)/(8*5) = 1/4\nSo the answer is 1/4 = 25%\n#### 25\n"}, {"text": "\nEllen started with 12 sodas - 3 shaken, 1 unshaken.\nShe took 1 soda home, leaving 12-3-1+1=6\nEllen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken, so 3+2=5\nEllen's friend took 1 shaken soda out of the remaining 6 soda, so 1/6\n1 out of 6 is 1/6 = 16.66%\nThe probability is 1/6\n#### 16.66\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEllen decided to play a prank on her friend.
