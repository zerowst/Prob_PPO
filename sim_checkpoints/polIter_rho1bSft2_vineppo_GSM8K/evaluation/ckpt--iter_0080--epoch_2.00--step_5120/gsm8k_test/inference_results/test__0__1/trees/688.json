If John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework and 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, how many minutes does John have to nap?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to find out how long John has to eat dinner. We know he has to be done eating before 3 hours from now, so we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so we multiply 3 hours * (60 minutes/hour) = 180 minutes.\nNext, we need to find out how long John has to be working on homework before he can take a nap. We add up the time for the math, reading, and history homework, 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.\nWe now subtract this time from the amount of time John has before he has to eat dinner, 180 minutes \u2013 80 minutes = 100 minutes.\nJohn has to nap for 100 of his 20-minute math homework.\n#### 100\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.6392775028944, "len_probs": 206, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to find out how long John has to eat dinner.
