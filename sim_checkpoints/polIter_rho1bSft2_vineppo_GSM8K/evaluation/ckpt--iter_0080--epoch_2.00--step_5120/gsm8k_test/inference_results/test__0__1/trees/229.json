Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter she came back, 84 x (3/4) = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.\nSo, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nThat means 21 were not ready after two weeks.\nSo, 21 is the answer.\nThe number of unharvested baby watermelons is 21.\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.899913646280766, "len_probs": 168, "answer": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter she came back, 84 x (3/4) = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.\nSo, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nThat means 21 were not ready after two weeks.\nSo, 21 is the answer.\nThe number of unharvested baby watermelons is 21.\n#### 21\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons left.\nAfter she came back, 84 x (3/4) = 63 melons were ready for harvest.\nSo, there were 36 - 63 = 27 melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nThat is 27 melons in all after the two weeks were harvested.\nSo, there were 36 - 27 = 9 melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks before she was harvested.\n#### 9\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
