Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece on Monday, which is a total of 0.45*5=2.25 inches of chalk.\nThis means he used 1 of the 5-inch pieces that the teacher recycles.\nSince the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.\nThis means that the teacher has 2.25 inches of chalk left before he has to recycle it.\nThe teacher has 2.25/2=1.125 inches of chalk left before he has to recycle it\nThat means he has to recycle this piece of chalk 1.125/0.2=5.625\nSo the answer is 5.625\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.52073521912098, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece on Monday, which is a total of 0.45*5=2.25 inches of chalk.\nThis means he used 1 of the 5-inch pieces that the teacher recycles.\nSince the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.\nThis means that the teacher has 2.25 inches of chalk left before he has to recycle it.\nThe teacher has 2.25/2=1.125 inches of chalk left before he has to recycle it\nThat means he has to recycle this piece of chalk 1.125/0.2=5.625\nSo the answer is 5.625\n#### 5\n"}, {"text": "\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece on Monday, which is a total of 0.45*5 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\nHe had to recycle the chalk because 2.25 < 2 (the chalk is smaller than 2 inches).\nThis means that he had to recycle 1 piece of chalk because 2.25 is the first number that is smaller than 2.\nHe used the chalk for 2 days before he had to recycle it because 45% is the first number that is smaller than 20% (the chalk is only 20% used).\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students.
