We know that for every 25 phone calls, one person comes in to buy a car. So, we take 25 phone calls per customer and divide by the total number of customers to determine the number of calls per customer that need to be made to sell 1 car. 25 calls / customer / total customers = calls per customer\nFinally, we multiply the number of calls per customer by the total number of customers needed to sell 1 car and the total number of cars Jason needs to sell to reach his goal. 15 cars * (15 customers / 2 customers) = 15\nSo Jason needs to make 15 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -47.406850066035986, "len_probs": 288, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how many customers are needed to buy one car.
