A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of boxes loaded onto the truck. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight is 15x pounds.\nThe combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, so the driver weighs 3755 - 15x pounds.\nThe bridge weight limit is 5000 pounds, so we can write: 3755 - 15x <= 5000.\nSubtract 3755 from both sides: -15x <= 5000 - 3755 = 1245.\nDivide both sides by -15 (and reverse the inequality sign): x >= -83.33.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes is 83.\n#### 83\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.641467109322548, "len_probs": 199, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of boxes loaded onto the truck.
