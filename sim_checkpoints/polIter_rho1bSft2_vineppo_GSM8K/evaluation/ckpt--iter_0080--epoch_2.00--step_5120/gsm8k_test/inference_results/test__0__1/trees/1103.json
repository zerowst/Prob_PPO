How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nLet J be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.\nThe number of large jellyfish is J/5.\nThe number of large jellyfish that change color is (J/5) * (1/3) = J/15.\nThe number of small jellyfish is J - (J/5) - (J/15) = 5J/15 - J/15 - J/15 = J/15.\nThe number of jellyfish that turned on the UV light is J.\nThe number of jellyfish that changed color is J/15.\nThe number of jellyfish that turned on the UV light and changed color is J/15.\nTherefore a total of J - (J/5) - (J/15) = 6 jellyfish turned on the UV light.\nThis is a 1-15-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -25.466826986521482, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nLet J be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.\nThe number of large jellyfish is J/5.\nThe number of large jellyfish that change color is (J/5) * (1/3) = J/15.\nThe number of small jellyfish is J - (J/5) - (J/15) = 5J/15 - J/15 - J/15 = J/15.\nThe number of jellyfish that turned on the UV light is J.\nThe number of jellyfish that changed color is J/15.\nThe number of jellyfish that turned on the UV light and changed color is J/15.\nTherefore a total of J - (J/5) - (J/15) = 6 jellyfish turned on the UV light.\nThis is a 1-15-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-"}, {"text": "\nLet J be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.\nThe number of large jellyfish is J/5.\nThe number of large jellyfish that change color is (J/5) * (1/3) = J/15.\nThe number of small jellyfish is J - (J/5) - (J/15) = J - (5J/15 - J/3) = J - (J/3 + J/5) = J - (5J/15 + 3J/15) = J - 8J/15 = J/5\nThere are J/5 large jellyfish and J/5 small jellyfish, so together they make a total of J.\nThe number of jellyfish that are blue is J/5 + J/5 = J/3.\nSince the number of jellyfish that are blue changed from 6 to 6 + 7 jellyfish (the ones that turned blue), we can set up the equation:\nJ/3 = 6 + 7\nJ = 6 + 7 * 3\nJ = 6 + 21 = 27 jellyfish\n#### 27\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it.
