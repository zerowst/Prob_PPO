How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?\n\nSolution:\nMr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, and each pack contains 8 glue sticks, so he needs 2 glue sticks/student * (27 students / class) = 54 glue sticks in total.\nSince he can\u2019t buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 pack of glue sticks. He\u2019ll have 1 pack left over, so he can give the extra glue sticks to the students who don\u2019t get a full pack.\nSo Mr. Jackson needs to buy 1 pack of glue sticks to give to the class, leaving him with 1 pack left over.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.131861113011837, "len_probs": 152, "answer": "\nMr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, and each pack contains 8 glue sticks, so he needs 2 glue sticks/student * (27 students / class) = 54 glue sticks in total.\nSince he can\u2019t buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 pack of glue sticks.
