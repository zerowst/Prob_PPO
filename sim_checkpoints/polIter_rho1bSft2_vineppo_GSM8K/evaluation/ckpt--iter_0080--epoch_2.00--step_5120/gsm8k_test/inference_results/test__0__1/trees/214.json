Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the amount of water in the small pool initially.\nAfter 4 minutes, the small pool had x*2/3 (since it loses 4/minute * 4 minutes = 4*2/3 gallons of water).\nNow the small pool has x - x*2/3 = 4*x/3\nSo now the small pool has 4 times the amount of water the big pool has.\nThis means: 4*x/3 = 4*x\nSo x = 4*x\nSo the small pool has no more water, it was empty.\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -25.06162740290165, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nLet x be the amount of water in the small pool initially.\nAfter 4 minutes, the small pool had x*2/3 (since it loses 4/minute * 4 minutes = 4*2/3 gallons of water).\nNow the small pool has x -
