120 = 20 miles apart.\nSo the answer is 20.\nThis is the answer to the question \"How many miles will separate them after 2 hours?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"How many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question \"After 2 hours, how many miles will separate the two cars?\".\nThis is the answer to the question", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -23.31412510201335, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe first car will travel 60 miles per hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.\nThe second car will travel 70 miles per hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.\nSo after 2 hours, they will be a total of 140 -
