Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane flies to Greece for 3 / 4 * 2 * 365 = 279 trips.\nThe other plane flies to Germany for the rest of its trips, which is 365 - 44 = 321 trips.\nSo the other plane flies to Germany for 321 / 2 = 160 trips.\nThus the first plane takes 279 + 160 = 439 trips to France.\nSo the answer is 439.\n#### 439\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.737944066524506, "len_probs": 133, "answer": "\nThe first plane flies to Greece for 3 / 4 * 2 * 365 = 279 trips.\nThe other plane flies to Germany for the rest of its trips, which is 365 - 44 = 321 trips.\nSo the other plane flies to Germany for 321 / 2 = 160 trips.\nThus the first plane takes 279 + 160 = 439 trips to France.\nSo the answer is 439.\n#### 439\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first plane flies 2 * 0.75 * (total flights - 1) trips to France,\nbecause the remaining flights after Greece are split equally between France and Germany.\nThe second plane flies 2 * 0.5 * (total flights - 1) trips to France,\nbecause it only flies to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.\nSo, 2 * 0.75 * (total flights - 1) = 2 * 0.5 * (total flights - 1)\n0.75 * (total flights - 1) = 0.5 * (total flights - 1)\n0.75 = 0.5\nThere are 44 trips, so the first plane takes 44 / 2 = 22 trips to France\nTherefore, the first plane takes 22 flights * 1 flight per 2 trips = 11 flights\n#### 11\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
