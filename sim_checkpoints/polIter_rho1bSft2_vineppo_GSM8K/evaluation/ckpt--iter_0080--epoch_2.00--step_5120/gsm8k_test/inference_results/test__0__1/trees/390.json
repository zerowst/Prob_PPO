She has 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift with it. How many inches of ribbon can she use for each gift bow?\n\nSolution:\nMonica has 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts to wrap.\nShe wants to make 1 bow for each gift, so she will use up 12 bows.\nThus she will use up 12 x (the length of the ribbon she uses for each bow) inches of ribbon.\nIf we let x be the length of the ribbon she uses for each bow, we can write this as 12x= the total length of ribbon she will use for all the bows\nWe can now solve the equation: 12x= the total length of ribbon she will use for all the bows\n(12 x the length of the ribbon she uses for each bow) = (the total length of ribbon she will use for all the bows)\nThe answer is 12x=144.\nSo the answer is x=144/12.\nSo the answer is x=12 inches.\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.12892498075962, "len_probs": 221, "answer": "\nMonica has 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts to wrap.\nShe wants to make 1 bow for each gift, so she will use up 12 bows.\nThus she will use up 12 x (the length of the ribbon she uses for each bow) inches of ribbon.\nIf we let x be the length of the ribbon she uses for each bow, we can write this as 12x= the total length of ribbon she will use for all the bows\nWe can now solve the equation: 12x= the total length of ribbon she will use for all the bows\n(12 x the length of the ribbon she uses for each bow) = (the total length of ribbon she will use for all the bows)\nThe answer is 12x=144.\nSo the answer is x=144/12.\nSo the answer is x=12 inches.\n#### 12\n"}, {"text": "\nMonica has a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts to wrap.\nShe wants to make a bow for each gift, so she will use 12 gifts * the amount of ribbon each gift bow uses\nShe has 144 total inches of ribbon, so this means she can only make 12 bows * X inches of ribbon per bow = 144\nThis is true for X=12\nTherefore:\nEach gift bow will use 12 inches of ribbon from the total 144 inches of ribbon, 12 inches of ribbon * (the amount of bows she makes) = 144\nThe amount of ribbon per gift bow is the total amount of ribbon divided by the number of bows, 144 inches / (the number of bows) = X\nSo the answer is X=12\n#### 12\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts.
