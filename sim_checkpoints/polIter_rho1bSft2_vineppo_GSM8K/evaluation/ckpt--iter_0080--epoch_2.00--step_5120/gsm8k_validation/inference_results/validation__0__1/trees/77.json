There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of machines in the launderette.\nEach machine holds 80 quarters / 1 + (80 quarters / 4) + (100 dimes / 1 + (100 dimes / 2)) dollars\n= 80 quarters / x + (80 quarters / 4) + 100 dimes / x + (100 dimes / 2)\n= 80 quarters + 80 quarters + 100 dimes + 100 dimes / x\n= 240 quarters + 100 dimes / x\nSince each machine is worth the same amount, we can set this equal to 90 dollars and solve for x:\n240 quarters + 100 dimes / x = 90 dollars\n100 dimes / x = 90 dollars -
