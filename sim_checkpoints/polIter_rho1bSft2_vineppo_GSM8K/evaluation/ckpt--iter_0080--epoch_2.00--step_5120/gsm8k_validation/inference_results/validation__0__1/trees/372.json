Each cat has a collar decorated with gemstones.  Binkie has four times as many gemstones on his collar as does Frankie but Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does Frankie.  If Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, how many gemstones does Binkie have on his collar?\n\nSolution:\nIf Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, and she has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does Frankie, then Frankie has 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\nWe know Frankie has # of Gemstones on her collar\nAnd we know Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar\nAnd we know that Binkie has 4 times as many Gemstones on his collar as Frankie\nSo, 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = # of Gemstones on Binkie's collar\nIf Frankie has 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\nthen 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\nAnd 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar = 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)/4\n# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar = (# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)/4\n# of Gemstones Binkie has on her collar = 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)/4 + 1\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.148050237447023, "len_probs": 516, "answer": "\nIf Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, and she has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does Frankie, then Frankie has 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\nWe know Frankie has # of Gemstones on her collar\nAnd we know Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar\nAnd we know that Binkie has 4 times as many Gemstones on his collar as Frankie\nSo, 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = # of Gemstones on Binkie's collar\nIf Frankie has 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\nthen 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\nAnd 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar) = 2 + (1/2)*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)\n# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar = 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)/4\n# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar = (# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)/4\n# of Gemstones Binkie has on her collar = 4*(# of Gemstones Frankie has on her collar)/4 + 1\n#### 4\n"}]}
