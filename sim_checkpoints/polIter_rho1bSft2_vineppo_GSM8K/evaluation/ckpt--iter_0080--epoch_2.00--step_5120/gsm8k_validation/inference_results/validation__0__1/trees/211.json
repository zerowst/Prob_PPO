"\nOlive has 10/2=5 fleas.\nMaud has 5*5=25 fleas.\nSo, the total amount of fleas is 10+5+25= 40 fleas.\nThere are 40 fleas on the chicken farm.\nThe chickens have a total of 40 fleas.\nThis is a good question to learn how to add and subtract fractions.\nThe total number of fleas is a good example of a mathematical expression that can be simplified using the rules of addition and subtraction.\nThis is a good question to learn how to use the distributive property.\nThe distributive property states that a(b+c)=ab+ac.\nSo, the total number of fleas is a good question to learn how to factor out a common factor.\nThe common factor in this problem is the number 5.\nFactoring out a 5 gives 5(8)=40.\nThis is a good question to learn how to divide a number by a fraction.\nThe fraction 5/1 is the same as 5 divided by 1.\nSo, 5(8)=40 is the same as 5(8)=5*8.\nThis is a good question to learn how to multiply a fraction by a whole number.\nThe whole number 8 is the same as 8.\nSo, 5(8)=40 is the
