If mixing the ingredients takes 10 minutes and baking the croissants takes 30 minutes, how many hours does the whole process take?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to calculate the total time Milly spends folding the dough. This is 4 folds * 5 minutes per fold = 20 minutes.\nNext, we add the resting time. Each time the dough is folded, it rests for 75 minutes, so 4 times * 75 minutes per time = 300 minutes.\nWe add the baking time, 30 minutes for each of the 4 croissants, so 4 croissants * 30 minutes per croissant = 120 minutes.\nNow we add all the times together: 20 minutes + 300 minutes + 120 minutes = 440 minutes\nLastly, we convert the minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 440 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 7 hours\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.756280593574047, "len_probs": 199, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to calculate the total time Milly spends folding the dough.
