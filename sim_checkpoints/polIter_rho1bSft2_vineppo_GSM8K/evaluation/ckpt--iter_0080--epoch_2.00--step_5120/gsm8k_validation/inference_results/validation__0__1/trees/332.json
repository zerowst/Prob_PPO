Staying at the hotel cost was $1.50 per hour every night and $2 per hour every morning. If Ed had $80 and he stayed in the hotel for 6 hours last night and 4 hours this morning, how much money was he left with after paying for his stay at the hotel?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for staying at the hotel last night is $1.50 x 6 = $9.\nThe total cost for staying at the hotel this morning is $2 x 4 = $8.\nThe total cost for his stay at the hotel is $9 + $8 = $17.\nHence, he was left with $80 - $17 = $63 after 6 nights and 4 mornings.\nSo he was left with $63.\nThere is a good chance that he is going to get a refund of some amount of money.\nSo Ed will be left with a lot of money.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo money left.\nNo", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -29.39260894805193, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe total cost for staying at the hotel last night is $1.50 x 6 = $9.\nThe total cost for staying at the hotel this morning is $2 x 4 = $8.\nThe total cost for his stay at the hotel is $9 + $8 = $17.\nHence, he was left with $80 -
