The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?\n\nSolution:\nThe second movie was 1 hour and 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 + 30 = 1 hour and 60 minutes long.\nThey spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, so they spent 10 + (2*10) = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes\nThey also watched the movies, so they spent 30 minutes after the movies.\nThe movies and the time after the movies, in total, 30 + 10 = 40 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so after watching the movies and after cooking, they spent 40/60 hours = 4/6 hours\nThey spent 4/6 hours in the evening, so they had 2 - 4/6 = -2/6 hours\nThey spent 2/6 of a whole hour, so they were 1/3 of an hour left, which is 1/3 * 60 minutes = 20 minutes\nThey watched 30 minutes after the movies and 40 minutes in the evening, so in total they watched 30+40 = 70 minutes\nThey were 20 minutes left, so they had to be 20 minutes in the evening.\nThey watched 70 minutes in the evening, so they were 20 minutes left after 4/6 of an hour\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -57.98766538500786, "len_probs": 331, "answer": "\nThe second movie was 1 hour and 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 + 30 = 1 hour and 60 minutes long.\nThey spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, so they spent 10 + (2*10) = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes\nThey also watched the movies, so they spent 30 minutes after the movies.\nThe movies and the time after the movies, in total, 30 + 10 = 40 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so after watching the movies and after cooking, they spent 40/60 hours = 4/6 hours\nThey spent 4/6 hours in the evening, so they had 2 - 4/6 = -2/6 hours\nThey spent 2/6 of a whole hour, so they were 1/3 of an hour left, which is 1/3 * 60 minutes = 20 minutes\nThey watched 30 minutes after the movies and 40 minutes in the evening, so in total they watched 30+40 = 70 minutes\nThey were 20 minutes left, so they had to be 20 minutes in the evening.\nThey watched 70 minutes in the evening, so they were 20 minutes left after 4/6 of an hour\n#### 20\n"}]}
