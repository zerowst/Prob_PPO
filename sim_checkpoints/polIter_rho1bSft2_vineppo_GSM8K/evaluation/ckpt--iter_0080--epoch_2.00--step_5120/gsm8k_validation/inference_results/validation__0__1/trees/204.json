two times as tall as the first building. The third building had to be three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings. If the first building was 600 feet, calculate the total height of the three buildings together.\n\nSolution:\nThe second building was two times as tall as the first building, so it was 2*600 = 1200 feet tall.\nThe third building was three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings, so it was 3*(600+1200) = 3*1800 = 5400 feet tall.\nAltogether, the three buildings were 600+1200+5400 = 7200 feet tall.\nThat was the combined height of the first three buildings.\nSo the answer is 7200.\nThe total height of the three buildings is 7200 feet.\nThe total height of the three buildings is the sum of the height of the first building, the second and third buildings.\nThe height of the first building is not given, but it is 600 feet.\nThe height of the third building is not given, but it is 5400 feet.\nThe height of the second building is given, which is 1200 feet.\nThe height of the combined height of the first and second buildings is 600+1200 = 1800 feet.\nThe height of the combined height of the first two buildings is 7200 feet.\nThe height of the third building is 5400 feet, which is the sum of the height of the combined height of the first two buildings and the height of the second building.\nIf the height of the first building is not given, we cannot calculate the total height of the three buildings.\nIf the height of the first building is given, we can calculate the total height of the three buildings.\nThe total height of the three buildings is 7200 feet.\n#### 7200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.51406582817435, "len_probs": 399, "answer": "\nThe second building was two times as tall as the first building, so it was 2*600 = 1200 feet tall.\nThe third building was three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings, so it was 3*(600+1200) = 3*1800 = 5400 feet tall.\nAltogether, the three buildings were 600+1200+5400 = 7200 feet tall.\nThat was the combined height of the first three buildings.\nSo the answer is 7200.\nThe total height of the three buildings is 7200 feet.\nThe total height of the three buildings is the sum of the height of the first building, the second and third buildings.\nThe height of the first building is not given, but it is 600 feet.\nThe height of the third building is not given, but it is 5400 feet.\nThe height of the second building is given, which is 1200 feet.\nThe height of the combined height of the first and second buildings is 600+1200 = 1800 feet.\nThe height of the combined height of the first two buildings is 7200 feet.\nThe height of the third building is 5400 feet, which is the sum of the height of the combined height of the first two buildings and the height of the second building.\nIf the height of the first building is not given, we cannot calculate the total height of the three buildings.\nIf the height of the first building is given, we can calculate the total height of the three buildings.\nThe total height of the three buildings is 7200 feet.\n#### 7200\n"}]}
