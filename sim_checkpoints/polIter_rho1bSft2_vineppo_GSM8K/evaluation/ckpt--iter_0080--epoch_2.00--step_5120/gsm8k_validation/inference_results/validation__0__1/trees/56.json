There are 12 cookies in a dozen, so we multiply 12 * (the number of dozen we want to know)\nFor 12 * 200, that's 2400 cookies.\nNext, we need to determine the amount of milk needed for 2400 cookies. We do this by multiplying 2400 by the fraction of a gallon of milk needed per cookie, which is 1/2 gallon per cookie.\n2400 * (1/2 gallon) = 1200/2 gallons\nWe can simplify this to 600/2 gallons, which is the amount of milk Juan needs to bake 200 dozen cookies.\n#### 600\n"}, {"text": "\nJuan needs 10 half-gallons of milk to bake 40 cookies, so he needs 10/40 * (amount of cookies you want to bake)\n200 dozen cookies is equal to 200*12=2400 cookies.\nSo Juan needs to mix 2400/40=60 half-gallons of milk to bake them.\nThat's the amount of milk he needs to mix with water to get 60/2=30 gallons of milk\nSo Juan needs 30*half-gallons of milk to bake 200 dozen cookies.\nThat's the same as saying he needs 30*half-gallons of milk to bake 200/12*4=60 cookies\nThat's the same as saying he needs 30*half-gallons of milk to bake 60 cookies\nSo the answer is 30.\n#### 30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJuan needs 10 half-gallons of milk to bake 40 cookies with.
