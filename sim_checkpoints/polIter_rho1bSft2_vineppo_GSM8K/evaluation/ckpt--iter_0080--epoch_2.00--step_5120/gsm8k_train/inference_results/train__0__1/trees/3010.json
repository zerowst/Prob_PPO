(the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSo, the number of pencils Caleb has now is (the number of pencils Caleb has now) - 5 = the number of pencils Caleb has now - 13.\nWe know that Calen originally had 5 more pencils than Caleb, so we have: 2*x - 13 = 5 + (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSubstituting 2*x - 13 for \"the number of pencils Caleb has now\" in the equation above, we get: 2*x - 13 = 5 + (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSubtracting 2*x from both sides, we get: -13 = 5 + (the number of pencils Caleb has now) - (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSo, the number of pencils Caleb has now is (the number of pencils Caleb has now) - 5 = the number of pencils Caleb has now - 13.\nWe know that Calen lost 10 pencils, so we have: 2*x - 10 = (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSubstituting 2*x - 13 for \"the number of pencils Caleb has now\" in the equation above, we get: 2*x - 10 = (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSubtracting 2*x from both sides, we get: -10 = (the number of pencils Caleb has now) - (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSo, the number of pencils Caleb has now is (the number of pencils Caleb has now) - 10 = the number of pencils Caleb has now + 10.\nWe know that Calen lost 10 pencils, so we have: (the number of pencils Caleb has now) - 10 = (the number of pencils Caleb has now).\nSo, the number of pencils Candy has is 10.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.96582219749689, "len_probs": 801, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of pencils Candy has.\nThe number of pencils Caleb has is 2*x -
