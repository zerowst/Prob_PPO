Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?\n\nSolution:\nToday, 90 x 2/3 = 60 students were in the cafeteria.\nRemaining outside, 90 -60 = 30 students were outside.\nThen 30/3 = 10 students went inside from outside to see what the fuss was about.\nAfter 3 went outside, there were 10 left in the outside area.\nThen 60 - 3 = 57 went inside from the cafeteria to see what all the fuss was about.\nNow 57 are inside, and some of the students outside went back to their group, leaving some in the cafeteria.\n#### 57\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.925406109541655, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nToday, 90 x 2/3 = 60 students were in the cafeteria.\nRemaining outside, 90 -60 = 30 students were outside.\nThen 30/3 = 10 students went inside from outside to see what the fuss was about.\nAfter 3 went outside, there were 10 left in the outside area.\nThen 60 - 3 = 57 went inside from the cafeteria to see what all the fuss was about.\nNow 57 are inside, and some of the students outside went back to their group, leaving some in the cafeteria.\n#### 57\n"}]}
