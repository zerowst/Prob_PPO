How many hours will she need to study before she is ready for the test?\n\nSolution:\nShe will take 30 x 15 = 450 minutes to learn all the multiple choice questions.\nShe will take 30 x 25 = 750 minutes to learn all the fill-in-the-blank questions.\nSo, she will take 450 + 750 = 1200 for all the questions.\nTherefore, 1200 is equal to 1200/60= 20 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)\nHence, she will need a total of 20 hours to prepare for the test.\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.494332171976566, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nShe will take 30 x 15 = 450 minutes to learn all the multiple choice questions.\nShe will take 30 x 25 = 750 minutes to learn all the fill-in-the-blank questions.\nSo, she will take 450 + 750 = 1200 for all the questions.\nTherefore, 1200 is equal to 1200/60= 20 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)\nHence, she will need a total of 20 hours to prepare for the test.\n#### 20\n"}, {"text": "\nShe has to learn 30 multiple-choice questions that take 15 minutes each to learn, so it takes 30*15=450 minutes to learn all the multiple-choice questions.\nShe has to learn 30 fill-in-the-blank questions that take 25 minutes each to learn, so it takes 30*25=750 minutes to learn all the fill-in-the-blank questions.\nIn total she needs 450+750=1200 minutes to learn for the test\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so to get the total number of minutes she needs to learn for the test, 1200/60=20 hours\n#### 20\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMartiza is studying for the citizenship test.
