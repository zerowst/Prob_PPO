How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\n\nSolution:\nMary took twice as long as Susan, who took 10 seconds longer than Jen, so Mary took 10+10+10 = 30 seconds\nSusan took 10 seconds longer than Jen, who took 30 seconds, so Susan took 10+30 = 40 seconds\nMary took 30 seconds, Susan took 40 seconds and Jen took 30 so together they took 30+40+30 = 100 seconds\nTiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary, who took 30 seconds, so Tiffany took 30-7 = 23 seconds\nTogether with the first 5 runners, the team took 100 seconds, so a total of 100+5*23 = 100+115 = 215 seconds\n#### 215\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.375724226236343, "len_probs": 207, "answer": "\nMary took twice as long as Susan, who took 10 seconds longer than Jen, so Mary took 10+10+10 = 30 seconds\nSusan took 10 seconds longer than Jen, who took 30 seconds, so Susan took 10+30 = 40 seconds\nMary took 30 seconds, Susan took 40 seconds and Jen took 30 so together they took 30+40+30 = 100 seconds\nTiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary, who took 30 seconds, so Tiffany took 30-7 = 23 seconds\nTogether with the first 5 runners, the team took 100 seconds, so a total of 100+5*23 = 100+115 = 215 seconds\n#### 215\n"}, {"text": "\nSusan took 30 seconds + 10 seconds = 40 seconds to run her leg.\nMary took 4 * 2 = 8 seconds to run her first leg.\nSo, the team took 30 + 40 + 8 = 78 seconds to finish all four legs of the relay race.\nTiffany took 8 seconds - 7 = 1 seconds less to finish the last leg.\nSo, Mary, Susan, and Tiffany took 78 - 1 = 77 seconds in total to finish the race.\nSo the answer is 77.\n#### 77\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\n4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race.
