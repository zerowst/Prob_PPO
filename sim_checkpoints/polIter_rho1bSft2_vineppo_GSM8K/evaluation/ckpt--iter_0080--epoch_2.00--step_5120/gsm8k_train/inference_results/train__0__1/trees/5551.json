But today scientists say one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay.  If there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay,  how many Pelicans remain in Shark Bite Cove?\n\nSolution:\nIf there are 60 sharks in Pelican Bay, and this number is twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove, then there were 60/2=30 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.\nIf scientists say that one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay, then this means that 30/3=10 Pelicans have moved.\nSince the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove is now known, and we know that 10 Pelicans have moved, this means that there were 30-10=20 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove before 10 moved.\nTherefore, if there are 20 Pelicans left in Shark Bite Cove, then the total number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove at one time was 0+20=20 Pelicans.\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.046435058116913, "len_probs": 213, "answer": "\nIf there are 60 sharks in Pelican Bay, and this number is twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove, then there were 60/2=30 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.\nIf scientists say that one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay, then this means that 30/3=10 Pelicans have moved.\nSince the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove is now known, and we know that 10 Pelicans have moved, this means that there were 30-10=20 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove before 10 moved.\nTherefore, if there are 20 Pelicans left in Shark Bite Cove, then the total number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove at one time was 0+20=20 Pelicans.\n#### 20\n"}, {"text": "\nIf there are 60 sharks in Pelican Bay, and this number is twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove, then there were 60/2=30 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.\nIf scientists say that one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay, then this means 1/3*30=10 Pelicans have moved.\nThis number, however, doesn't match with the number we're trying to find.\nThe problem is, we're trying to find the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove, and we're given the number of sharks in Pelican Bay.
