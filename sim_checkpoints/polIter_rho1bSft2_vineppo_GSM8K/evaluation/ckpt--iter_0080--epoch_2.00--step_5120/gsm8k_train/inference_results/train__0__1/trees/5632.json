She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?\n\nSolution:\nLilia earned 10 x $2 = $20 from her friends.\nShe earned 4 x $1.25 = $5 from her relatives.\nSo, she earned a total of $20 + $5 = $25 from the peaches she sold.\nThus, she earned a total of $15 (initial amount) - $25 (earned from selling) = -$10 after selling 14 peaches.\nHence, there is a loss of $10.\nSo, the final amount Lilia earned was 15 - 10 = $5.\nShe earned $5 from the remaining peaches she kept for herself.\nHence, she earned a total of $10 (loss) + $5 (earned amount from remaining peaches) = $5.\nThis is the correct answer, because the loss is always the same amount.\nSo the answer is $5.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -46.09233897551894, "len_probs": 212, "answer": "\nLilia earned 10 x $2 = $20 from her friends.\nShe earned 4 x $1.25 = $5 from her relatives.\nSo, she earned a total of $20 + $5 = $25 from the peaches she sold.\nThus, she earned a total of $15 (initial amount) - $25 (earned from selling) = -$10 after selling 14 peaches.\nHence, there is a loss of $10.\nSo, the final amount Lilia earned was 15 - 10 = $5.\nShe earned $5 from the remaining peaches she kept for herself.\nHence, she earned a total of $10 (loss) + $5 (earned amount from remaining peaches) = $5.\nThis is the correct answer, because the loss is always the same amount.\nSo the answer is $5.\n#### 5\n"}, {"text": "\nLilia earned 10 * $2 = $20 for selling the peaches to her friends.\nShe earned 4 * $1.25 = $5 from selling the peaches to her relatives.\nSo, she earned a total of $20 + $5 = $25 from the peaches she sold.\nHence, after selling 14 peaches, she still left with 1 peach, so she earned $25 - (4 * $1.25)\nHence, the answer is $25 - (4 * $1.25) = $25 - $5 = $20.\nTherefore she earned a total of the remaining peaches after selling 14 of them, so she earned $20 from the remaining peach.\nSo she earned a total of 14 peaches, 20 + the rest of the peaches she sold.\nThe rest of the peaches she sold, so she earned 14 - (the rest of the peaches she sold) * the rest of the peaches she sold\nHence, she earned a total of 14 * the rest of the peaches she sold = $20 from the remaining peaches.\nThis means she sold the rest of the peaches she sold for $20 / 14 peaches = $1.428\nTherefore she earned a total of $20 + the rest of the peaches she sold = $20 + $1.428 = $21.428\n#### 21.428\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nLilia has 15 peaches.
