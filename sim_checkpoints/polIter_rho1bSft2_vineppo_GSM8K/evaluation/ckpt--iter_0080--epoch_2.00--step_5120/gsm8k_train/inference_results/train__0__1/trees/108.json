Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking and 20 gallons per shower. He wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?\n\nSolution:\nThe pool measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet, so the volume of the pool is 10*10*6 = 600 cubic feet.\nJerry can only use 1000 gallons of water in July, and each shower uses 20 gallons, so he has enough water for 1000/20 = 50 showers.\nHe needs to fill the pool, so he can only use the amount of water he has for showers. If he fills the pool with water that he can use for showers, he can only fill 50 showers.\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.282009050250053, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nThe pool measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet, so the volume of the pool is 10*10*6 = 600 cubic feet.\nJerry can only use 1000 gallons of water in July, and each shower uses 20 gallons, so he has enough water for 1000/20 = 50 showers.\nHe needs to fill the pool, so he can only use the amount of water he has for showers.
