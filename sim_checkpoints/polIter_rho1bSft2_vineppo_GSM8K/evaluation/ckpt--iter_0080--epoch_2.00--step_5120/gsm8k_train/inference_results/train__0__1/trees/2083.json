He orders a steak and egg meal for $16.  He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?\n\nSolution:\nThe meals cost 16 + 14 = $30.\nHis friend paid 1/2 * $30 = $15.\nSo the total amount James paid was 30 - 15 = $15.\nHe paid a tip of 20% of the remaining amount, which was $15. So he paid a tip of (2/10)*$15 = $3.\nSo the total amount he paid was the meal cost, the tip, and his half of the bill, $15, $3, and the remaining $15 - $3 = $12.\nSo he paid that amount, which is 15 + 3 + (the remaining amount he paid)\nSo the answer is 15 + 3 + (the remaining amount he paid) = 18.\nJames paid the remaining amount, which is the answer.\nSo the answer is $18.\n#### 18\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -46.34100374951959, "len_probs": 214, "answer": "\nThe meals cost 16 + 14 = $30.\nHis friend paid 1/2 * $30 = $15.\nSo the total amount James paid was 30 - 15 = $15.\nHe paid a tip of 20% of the remaining amount, which was $15.
