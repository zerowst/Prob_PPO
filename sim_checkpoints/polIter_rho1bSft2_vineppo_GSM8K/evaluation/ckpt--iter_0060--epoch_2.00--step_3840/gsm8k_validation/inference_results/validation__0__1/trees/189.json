There are 15 people on the team. On the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets. On the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day by asking door-to-door. On the last day, they set up boxes at schools and got a total of 22 blankets. How many blankets did they collect for the three days for donation?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, each of the 15 team members gave 2 blankets, so the total number of blankets collected on the first day is 15 * 2 = 30 blankets.\nOn the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day, so they collected 3 * 30 = 90 blankets.\nOn the last day, they collected 22 blankets.\nSo, the total number of blankets they collected over the three days is 30 + 90 + 22 = 142 blankets.\nThe total number of blankets collected for the three days is 142.\n#### 142\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.658901691436768, "len_probs": 155, "answer": "\nOn the first day, each of the 15 team members gave 2 blankets, so the total number of blankets collected on the first day is 15 * 2 = 30 blankets.\nOn the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day, so they collected 3 * 30 = 90 blankets.\nOn the last day, they collected 22 blankets.\nSo, the total number of blankets they collected over the three days is 30 + 90 + 22 = 142 blankets.\nThe total number of blankets collected for the three days is 142.\n#### 142\n"}]}
