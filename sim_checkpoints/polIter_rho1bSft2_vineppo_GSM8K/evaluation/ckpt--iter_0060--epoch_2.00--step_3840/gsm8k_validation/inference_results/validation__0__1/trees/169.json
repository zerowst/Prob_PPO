He pays $2,000 in property taxes, $3,000 in sales taxes, and 10% of his gross salary in income taxes. What is Bill's gross salary?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to find out the net amount of money after paying property taxes and sales taxes. We do this by subtracting the property taxes and sales taxes from Bill's take-home salary: $40,000 - $2,000 - $3,000 = $37,000.\nNow we need to find out what 10% of Bill's gross salary is, so we multiply $37,000 by 0.10: $37,000 * 0.10 = $3,700.\nWe now know that after paying property taxes, sales taxes, and 10% of his gross salary, Bill is left with $37,000 - $3,700 = $33,300.\nTherefore Bill's gross salary is $33,300.\n#### 33,300\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.121100790798664, "len_probs": 220, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to find out the net amount of money after paying property taxes and sales taxes.
