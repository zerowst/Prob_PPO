So far, she has saved $1500. Since the birthday is still a few weeks away, Julie has time to save even more. She plans on mowing 20 lawns, delivering 600 newspapers, and walking 24 of her neighbors\u2019 dogs. She is paid $20 for each lawn, 40 cents per newspaper, and $15 per dog. After purchasing the bike, how much money will Julie have left?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, let\u2019s calculate how much money Julie will make from mowing lawns. She will mow 20 lawns * $20 per lawn = $400.\nNext, let\u2019s calculate how much money Julie will make from delivering newspapers. She will deliver 600 newspapers * $0.40 per newspaper = $240.\nFinally, let\u2019s calculate how much money Julie will make from walking dogs. She will walk 24 dogs * $15 per dog = $360.\nNow, let\u2019s add up all of Julie\u2019s earnings so far: $400 + $240 + $360 = $1000.\nAdding this to her current savings, Julie will have $1500 + $1000 = $2500 after her work.\nSubtracting this amount from the cost of the bike, Julie will have $2345 - $2500 = -$155.\nJulie will be left with a negative amount of money, so she will need to save more money before she can buy her favorite bike.\n#### 155\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.931547246873379, "len_probs": 276, "answer": "\nFirst, let\u2019s calculate how much money Julie will make from mowing lawns.
