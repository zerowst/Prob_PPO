A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe school paid $100 * 2 = $200 for the 2 dinosaur models in the kindergarten library.\nThe price of each dinosaur model was reduced by 5%, so the price was reduced by 5/100 * $100 = $5.\nSo the price for each dinosaur model was $100 - $5 = $95.\nThus, the school paid $95 * 100 = $9500 in total for the dinosaur models.\n#### 9500\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.562925174832344, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe school paid $100 * 2 = $200 for the 2 dinosaur models in the kindergarten library.\nThe price of each dinosaur model was reduced by 5%, so the price was reduced by 5/100 * $100 = $5.\nSo the price for each dinosaur model was $100 - $5 = $95.\nThus, the school paid $95 * 100 = $9500 in total for the dinosaur models.\n#### 9500\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe school initially planned to pay 2 * $100 = $200 for all the models.\nBut after the discount, the price for each model was $100 - 5% of $100 = $100 - $5 = $95.\nSo the school paid 6 * $95 = $570 in total.\nThat's a discount of $570 - $200 = $370.\nThe school saved $370 on the dinosaur models.\n#### 370\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
