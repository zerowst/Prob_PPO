There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nEach machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nThe total value of all the coins in all the machines is $90.\nSo the total value of all the quarters and dimes in all the machines is $90.\nThis means there were a total of 180 quarters and 180 dimes together in all the machines.\nSo the total number of coins in all the machines is the number of quarters and dimes together, which is 180 + 180 = 360 coins.\nIf there were 360 coins in all the machines and each machine is worth a total of $90, then there must be 360 coins / $90 = 4 machines in the launderette.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.98030123114586, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nEach machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nThe total value of all the coins in all the machines is $90.\nSo the total value of all the quarters and dimes in all the machines is $90.\nThis means there were a total of 180 quarters and 180 dimes together in all the machines.\nSo the total number of coins in all the machines is the number of quarters and dimes together, which is 180 + 180 = 360 coins.\nIf there were 360 coins in all the machines and each machine is worth a total of $90, then there must be 360 coins / $90 = 4 machines in the launderette.\n#### 4\n"}, {"text": "\nEach machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins total.\nIf she got a total of $90 from emptying all of the machines, then she got 90 dollars\u2019 worth of change from all the coins.\nThat means she got 180 dollars\u2019 worth of change from all the coins, since she had no money before she emptied the machines.\nSo, the total number of coins in all the machines was worth $90 in change.\nThat means there were 90 dollars\u2019 worth of change from all the coins, since she got 180 dollars\u2019 worth of change from all the coins.\nSo, the number of coins in all the machines must have been 90 dollars\u2019 worth of change / 180 dollars\u2019 worth of change per coin = 5 coins per dollar of change.\nTherefore, the number of machines in the launderette must have been 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins, divided by 5 coins per dollar of change, must have been 180 coins / 5 coins per dollar of change = 36 machines.\n#### 36\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
