She can read 40 words per minute. The books she is checking out have 100 words per page and are 80 pages long. She will be reading for 20 hours. How many books should she check out?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to calculate how many words Sarah can read in 20 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 20 hours there are 20*60 = 1200 minutes.\nSarah can read 40 words per minute, so in 1200 minutes she can read 1200*40 = 48,000 words.\nThen we need to calculate how many pages are in the books Sarah is checking out. If there are 100 words per page and the book has 80 pages, then there are 100*80 = 8,000 words in all the books.\nFinally, we divide the total number of words she can read by the number of words in a book to find the number of books she should check out: 48,000 words / 8,000 words per book = 6 books.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.354051236063242, "len_probs": 215, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to calculate how many words Sarah can read in 20 hours.
