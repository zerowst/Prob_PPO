She has 130 seconds of the point guard, 145 seconds of the shooting guard, 85 seconds of the small forward, 60 seconds of the power forward, and 180 seconds of the center. How on average, how many minutes does each player get?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount of time for all players is 130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = 500 seconds.\nThe total amount of time for all players is 500 seconds.\nThere are 5 players in the team.\nTherefore, the average amount of time each player gets is 500 / 5 = 100 seconds per player.\nTo convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, so 100 / 60 = 1.67 minutes per player.\nSo the answer is 1.67 minutes per player.\n#### 1.67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.617424957454205, "len_probs": 150, "answer": "\nThe total amount of time for all players is 130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = 500 seconds.\nThe total amount of time for all players is 500 seconds.\nThere are 5 players in the team.\nTherefore, the average amount of time each player gets is 500 / 5 = 100 seconds per player.\nTo convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, so 100 / 60 = 1.67 minutes per player.\nSo the answer is 1.67 minutes per player.\n#### 1.67\n"}]}
