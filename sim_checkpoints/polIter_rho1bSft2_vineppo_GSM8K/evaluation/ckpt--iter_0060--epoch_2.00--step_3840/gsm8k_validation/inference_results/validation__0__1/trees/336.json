people = 60 marbles.\nSo, the total number of marbles they will get is the same as the total number of marbles they combined, which is 60 marbles.\nSo, the answer is 60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles they will get is the same as the total number of marbles they combined, which is 60 marbles.\nSo, the answer is 60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles they will get is the same as the total number of marbles they combined, which is 60 marbles.\nSo, the answer is 60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles they will get is the same as the total number of marbles they combined, which is 60 marbles.\nSo, the answer is 60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles they will get is the same as the total number of marbles they combined, which is 60 marbles.\nSo, the answer is 60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles they will get is the same as the total number of marbles they combined, which is 60 marbles.\nSo, the answer is 60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles they will get is the
