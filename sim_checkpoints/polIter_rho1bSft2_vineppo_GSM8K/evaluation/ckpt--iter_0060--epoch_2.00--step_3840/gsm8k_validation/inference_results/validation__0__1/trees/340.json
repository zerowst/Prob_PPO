The 5 players, including Jess, play 5 rounds in which each player removes one block. In the sixth round, Jess's father goes first. He removes a block, causing the tower to almost fall. Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. How many blocks did the tower have before Jess's turn?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is 5 rounds * 1 block removed per round = 5 blocks.\nIn the sixth round, the tower fell almost 1 block short of 5 blocks, so we can say that in the sixth round, the tower had 5 blocks - 1 block = 4 blocks.\nAfter Jess's father's turn in the sixth round, the tower fell 1 block short of 4 blocks, so we can say that in the sixth round, the tower had 4 blocks + 1 block = 5 blocks.\nIn the fifth round, Jess's father did not remove a block, so the tower had 5 blocks + 1 block = 6 blocks before his turn.\nSo the answer is, before Jess's turn, the tower had 6 blocks + 1 block = 7 blocks.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.636867210268974, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nIn the first 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is 5 rounds * 1 block removed per round = 5 blocks.\nIn the sixth round, the tower fell almost 1 block short of 5 blocks, so we can say that in the sixth round, the tower had 5 blocks - 1 block = 4 blocks.\nAfter Jess's father's turn in the sixth round, the tower fell 1 block short of 4 blocks, so we can say that in the sixth round, the tower had 4 blocks + 1 block = 5 blocks.\nIn the fifth round, Jess's father did not remove a block, so the tower had 5 blocks + 1 block = 6 blocks before his turn.\nSo the answer is, before Jess's turn, the tower had 6 blocks + 1 block = 7 blocks.\n#### 7\n"}]}
