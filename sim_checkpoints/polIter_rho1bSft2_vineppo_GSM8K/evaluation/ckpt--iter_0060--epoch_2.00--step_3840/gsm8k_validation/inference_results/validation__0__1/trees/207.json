Each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer. If Carson uses 60 gallons of seed and fertilizer combined, how many gallons of seed does he use?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of gallons of fertilizer Carson uses.\nEach square meter needs 3 * (3 times the amount of fertilizer) = 9 times the amount of fertilizer.\nSo the number of square meters he covers is 60 / (9 times the amount of fertilizer) = x\nIf the total amount of seed and fertilizer is 60 gallons, then the number of gallons of seed he uses is 60 - (9 times the amount of fertilizer) x\nSo the answer is 60 - (9 times the amount of fertilizer) x = 60 - (9x)\n#### 60 - (9x)\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 60\n#### 6", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -20.16288322210312, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of gallons of fertilizer Carson uses.\nEach square meter needs 3 * (3 times the amount of fertilizer) = 9 times the amount of fertilizer.\nSo the number of square meters he covers is 60 / (9 times the amount of fertilizer) = x\nIf the total amount of seed and fertilizer is 60 gallons, then the number of gallons of seed he uses is 60 -
