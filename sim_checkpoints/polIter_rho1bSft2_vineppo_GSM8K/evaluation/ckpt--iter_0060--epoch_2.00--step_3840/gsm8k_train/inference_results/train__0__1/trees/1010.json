Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?\n\nSolution:\nTwo-thirds of the students in period 5 lunch, or 90*(2/3)=60 students sat in the cafeteria.\nThe remainder, or 90-60=30 students, sat outside.\nOne-third of the students outside, or 30*(1/3)=10 students, ran inside to the cafeteria.\nThe number of students in the cafeteria was then 60-3(the number who ran in) +10 = 70\n#### 70\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.626388628035784, "len_probs": 124, "answer": "\nTwo-thirds of the students in period 5 lunch, or 90*(2/3)=60 students sat in the cafeteria.\nThe remainder, or 90-60=30 students, sat outside.\nOne-third of the students outside, or 30*(1/3)=10 students, ran inside to the cafeteria.\nThe number of students in the cafeteria was then 60-3(the number who ran in) +10 = 70\n#### 70\n"}]}
