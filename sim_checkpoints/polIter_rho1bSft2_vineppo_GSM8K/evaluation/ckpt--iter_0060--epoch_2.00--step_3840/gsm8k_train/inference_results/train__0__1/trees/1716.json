How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount of money collected was 25 students * $50 = $1250.\nThere were 25 students in the class, so 4 students left out of the $50 amount is 4 students * $50 = $200.\nSo the total amount of money the class was able to gather is $1250 - $200 = $1250.\n#### 1250\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.800358183681965, "len_probs": 100, "answer": "\nThe total amount of money collected was 25 students * $50 = $1250.\nThere were 25 students in the class, so 4 students left out of the $50 amount is 4 students * $50 = $200.\nSo the total amount of money the class was able to gather is $1250 - $200 = $1250.\n#### 1250\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total amount of money collected was 25 * $50 = $1250.\nThere were 25 - 4 = 21 students who paid the full amount.\nSo they all paid a total of 21 * $50 = $1050.\nThere were 4 students who paid only half, so they all paid a total of 4 * $50/2 = $100.\nThus the 4 students who paid half only should not be counted twice.\nThe total of the amount collected is $1050 + $100 - $100 (for the 4 students who paid half) = $1150.\n#### 1150\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIn Mary's class, there are 25 students.
