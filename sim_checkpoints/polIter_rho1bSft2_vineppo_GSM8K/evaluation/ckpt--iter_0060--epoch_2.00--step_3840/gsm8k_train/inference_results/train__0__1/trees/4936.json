A friend knows that Kim has a bunch of shiny new earrings that she loves. She agrees to give Kim 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings. On the first day, Kim brings her 3 pairs of earrings. On the second she brings her twice as many. On the third day, she brings 1 less than she brought on the second day. If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?\n\nSolution:\nOn the second day she brings twice as many pairs as the first day, so she brings 3*2=6 pairs.\nOn the third day she brings 6-1=5 pairs.\nIn those 3 days she brings 3+6+5=14 pairs.\nIf she gets 9 gumballs per pair, in 14 days she gets 14*9=126.\nIf she eats 3 gumballs a day, she will last 126/3=42 days.\n#### 42\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.157315194606781, "len_probs": 126, "answer": "\nOn the second day she brings twice as many pairs as the first day, so she brings 3*2=6 pairs.\nOn the third day she brings 6-1=5 pairs.\nIn those 3 days she brings 3+6+5=14 pairs.\nIf she gets 9 gumballs per pair, in 14 days she gets 14*9=126.\nIf she eats 3 gumballs a day, she will last 126/3=42 days.\n#### 42\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the second day, Kim brings 2 * 3 pairs = 6 pairs of earrings.\nOn the third day, Kim brings 6 pairs - 1 pair = 5 pairs of earrings.\nIn all, these earrings are equal to 3 pairs + 6 pairs + 5 pairs = 14 pairs of earrings.\nIn all, the gumballs are equal to 9 * 14 = 126 gumballs.\nThere are 126 days until they are gone.\n#### 126\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKimberly loves gumballs and will trade almost anything she owns for them.
