And the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor.  How long, in feet, did the fourth competitor jump?\n\nSolution:\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, so his distance was 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, so the third competitor's distance was 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, so the fourth competitor's distance was 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nSo the fourth competitor jumped 24 feet.\nThat's the answer to the question, so that's the answer to the question. 24\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.868550330400467, "len_probs": 151, "answer": "\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, so his distance was 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, so the third competitor's distance was 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, so the fourth competitor's distance was 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nSo the fourth competitor jumped 24 feet.\nThat's the answer to the question, so that's the answer to the question. 24\n#### 24\n"}]}
