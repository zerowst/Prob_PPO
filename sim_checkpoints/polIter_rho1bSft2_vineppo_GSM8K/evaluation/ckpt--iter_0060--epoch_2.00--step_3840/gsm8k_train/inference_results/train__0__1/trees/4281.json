He ate 3 of them then gave his little brother 5 because he was behaving. He then handed the platter to his basketball team of eight members. The first player to arrive took 1, the second player to arrive took 3, the third player took 5, and so on. When the last player took his share, the platter was empty. How many chocolate cookies did Andy have from start with?\n\nSolution:\nAndy ate 3 cookies, then gave his brother 5, so 3 + 5 = 8 cookies were out of his platter.\nThe platter was empty after the last player took his share, so 8 cookies were left.\nThere was 1 left on the platter after Andy\u2019s 1, 3 after the second player\u2019s 1, 5 after the third player\u2019s 1, and so the final number for the platter is 1, 3, 5, ..., 8.\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a = 1, d = 2, and n = 8.\nThe last term is 8.\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is n/2(a + l) = 8/2(1 + 8) = 4(9) = 36.\n#### 36\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.415139138698578, "len_probs": 193, "answer": "\nAndy ate 3 cookies, then gave his brother 5, so 3 + 5 = 8 cookies were out of his platter.\nThe platter was empty after the last player took his share, so 8 cookies were left.\nThere was 1 left on the platter after Andy\u2019s 1, 3 after the second player\u2019s 1, 5 after the third player\u2019s 1, and so the final number for the platter is 1, 3, 5, ..., 8.\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a = 1, d = 2, and n = 8.\nThe last term is 8.\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is n/2(a + l) = 8/2(1 + 8) = 4(9) = 36.\n#### 36\n"}]}
