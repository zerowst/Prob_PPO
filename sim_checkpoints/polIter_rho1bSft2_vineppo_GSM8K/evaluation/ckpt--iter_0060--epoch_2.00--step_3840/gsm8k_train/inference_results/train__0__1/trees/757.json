The elevator needs to move down 20 floors to reach the bottom. It takes 15 minutes for the elevator to travel down the first half of the floors. The elevator then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors. It then takes 16 minutes per floor for the elevator to finish traveling down the final 5 floors. In hours, how long did it take for the elevator to reach the bottom?\n\nSolution:\nThe elevator traveled down 1/2 * 20 = 10 floors in the first half of the journey.\nIt took 15 minutes to travel down the first 10 floors, so it took 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours.\nThe elevator then traveled down the next 5 floors, which took 5 minutes per floor * 5 floors = 25 minutes.\nThis took 25 / 60 = 0.4167 hours.\nThe final 5 floors took 16 minutes per floor * 5 floors = 80 minutes.\nThis took 80 / 60 = 1.3333 hours.\nSo the total time was 0.25 + 0.4167 + 1.3333 = 3.1167 hours\nThat\u2019s the time in hours, but we want it in minutes so we convert\n3.1167 hours * (60 minutes / 1 hour) = 186.002 minutes\n#### 186.002\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.552972234785557, "len_probs": 259, "answer": "\nThe elevator traveled down 1/2 * 20 = 10 floors in the first half of the journey.\nIt took 15 minutes to travel down the first 10 floors, so it took 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours.\nThe elevator then traveled down the next 5 floors, which took 5 minutes per floor * 5 floors = 25 minutes.\nThis took 25 / 60 = 0.4167 hours.\nThe final 5 floors took 16 minutes per floor * 5 floors = 80 minutes.\nThis took 80 / 60 = 1.3333 hours.\nSo the total time was 0.25 + 0.4167 + 1.3333 = 3.1167 hours\nThat\u2019s the time in hours, but we want it in minutes so we convert\n3.1167 hours * (60 minutes / 1 hour) = 186.002 minutes\n#### 186.002\n"}, {"text": "\nThe elevator traveled 1/2 * 20 = 10 floors in the first half of the journey.\nThe elevator took 15 + 5*5 = 40 minutes to travel the first half\nThe elevator took 16 * 5 = 80 minutes to travel the last 5 floors.\nIn total the elevator took 40 + 80 = 120 minutes\nIn hours, this is equal to 120/60 = 2 hours.\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMichael is stuck in an elevator that is slowly moving to the bottom floor.
