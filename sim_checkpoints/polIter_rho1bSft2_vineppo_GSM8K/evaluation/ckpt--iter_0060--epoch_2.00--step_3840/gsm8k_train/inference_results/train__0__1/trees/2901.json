Billy's steak costs $20 and Jenny's steak costs $20, so the total cost for both is $20 + $20 = $40.\nThe total cost for the steaks and drinks for both of them is $40.\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost for a 20% tip on the $40 order. 20% of $40 is (20/100)*$40 = $8.\nSo, the total cost for the tip is $8.\nNow, Billy wants to pay 80% of the 20% tip, so he needs to pay (80/100)*$8 = $6 in tips for the two of them.\nFinally, we need to calculate how much Billy will have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of the 20% tip. Billy will need to pay $6 in tips, so he will have to pay 80% of $6, which is (80/100)*$6 = $4.\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIf Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost for Billy and Jenny together.
