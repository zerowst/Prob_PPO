They sold broccolis, carrots, spinach, and cauliflowers. After adding together all of their earnings, Maya found out that they had made $380. The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?\n\nSolution:\nSince the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, and the total earnings from broccoli is $57, then the sales of carrots is 2 * $57 = $114.\nThen, the sales of the spinach are $16 more than half of the sales of carrots, meaning that the sales of spinach is $16 + (1/2)*$114 = $16 + $57 = $73.\nThe total earnings from these three vegetables is $57 + $73 + $114 = $244.\nThe total earnings from all the vegetables is $380, so the sales of the cauliflower is $380 - $244 = $136.\nHence, the cauliflower sales is $136.\n#### 136\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.389947205781937, "len_probs": 207, "answer": "\nSince the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, and the total earnings from broccoli is $57, then the sales of carrots is 2 * $57 = $114.\nThen, the sales of the spinach are $16 more than half of the sales of carrots, meaning that the sales of spinach is $16 + (1/2)*$114 = $16 + $57 = $73.\nThe total earnings from these three vegetables is $57 + $73 + $114 = $244.\nThe total earnings from all the vegetables is $380, so the sales of the cauliflower is $380 - $244 = $136.\nHence, the cauliflower sales is $136.\n#### 136\n"}, {"text": "\nSince the sales of the carrots is twice as much as the sales of broccoli, and the sales of broccoli is $57, then the sales of carrots is 2 * $57 = $114.\nThe sales of the spinach are $16 more than half of the sales of carrots, meaning that the sales of spinach is 1/2 * $114 + $16 = $57 + $16 = $73.\nThe total earnings from these three vegetables is $57 + $114 + $73 = $244.\nThe earnings from all the vegetables combined is $380, meaning that the earnings from broccoli is $380 - $244 = $136.\nThus, the organization made $136 from selling cauliflower.\n#### 136\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMaya's organization hosted a weekly farmers' market to raise money for the church choir.
