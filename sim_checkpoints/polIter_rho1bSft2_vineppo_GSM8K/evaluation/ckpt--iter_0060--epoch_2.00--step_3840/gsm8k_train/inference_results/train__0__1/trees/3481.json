Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms + 7 bathrooms = 19 rooms.\nThus, the entire space station, with three identical cylindrical structures, has a total of 3 * 19 = 57 rooms.\nThis means that the entire space station has a total of 72 rooms - 57 rooms = 15 kitchens.\nThus the entire space station has a total of 15 kitchens, or 15 / 12 = 1.25 kitchens per cylindrical structure.\nThere are thus a total of 72 rooms / 1.25 kitchens per cylindrical structure = 61.6, or 62 kitchens in all.\n#### 62\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.569652535021305, "len_probs": 175, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms + 7 bathrooms = 19 rooms.\nThus, the entire space station, with three identical cylindrical structures, has a total of 3 * 19 = 57 rooms.\nThis means that the entire space station has a total of 72 rooms - 57 rooms = 15 kitchens.\nThus the entire space station has a total of 15 kitchens, or 15 / 12 = 1.25 kitchens per cylindrical structure.\nThere are thus a total of 72 rooms / 1.25 kitchens per cylindrical structure = 61.6, or 62 kitchens in all.\n#### 62\n"}, {"text": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.
