Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?\n\nSolution:\nAfter the first two apples fell, Newton had 2 + 1 = 3 apples.\nAfter the second set of apples fell, he had 3 + 5 = 8 apples.\nAfter the third set of apples fell, he had 8 + 6 = 14 apples.\nSo he had 14 apples after picking up the last two apples in his pocket.\nHe took this set of 14 apples to his home, added the 1 apple he kept, and brought home 14 + 1 = 15 apples.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.73375292867422, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nAfter the first two apples fell, Newton had 2 + 1 = 3 apples.\nAfter the second set of apples fell, he had 3 + 5 = 8 apples.\nAfter the third set of apples fell, he had 8 + 6 = 14 apples.\nSo he had 14 apples after picking up the last two apples in his pocket.\nHe took this set of 14 apples to his home, added the 1 apple he kept, and brought home 14 + 1 = 15 apples.\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter picking up the two apples in his pocket, Newton threw one into the tree, causing 5 more to fall out.
