On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?\n\nSolution:\nAfter the first stop, 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain.\n5 times as many people get on the bus as got off on the first stop, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on.\nThis is a total of 40 + 8 = 48 passengers.\nOn the second stop, 21 passengers got off, so there were 40 - 21 = 19 passengers.\nThen 3 times fewer passengers got on than were there before they got off, so 40 - 9 = 31 passengers got on.\nThere was a total of 19 + 31 = 50 passengers after the second stop.\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.46685130894184, "len_probs": 160, "answer": "\nAfter the first stop, 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain.\n5 times as many people get on the bus as got off on the first stop, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on.\nThis is a total of 40 + 8 = 48 passengers.\nOn the second stop, 21 passengers got off, so there were 40 - 21 = 19 passengers.\nThen 3 times fewer passengers got on than were there before they got off, so 40 - 9 = 31 passengers got on.\nThere was a total of 19 + 31 = 50 passengers after the second stop.\n#### 50\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first stop, 5 times as many people got on as got off, so 8 passengers got off + 5*8 passengers who got on = 8 + 40 = 48\nThere were originally 48 passengers on the bus, so after the first stop, there were 48 - 21 = 27 passengers.\nOn the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers got on, so 21 passengers got on, but there were only 48 - 8 passengers who got off, so 21 - (4*21/3) = 21 - 8 = 13 new passengers got on.\nSo after the second stop, there were 27 + 13 = 40 passengers.\n#### 40\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\n48 people are riding a bus.
