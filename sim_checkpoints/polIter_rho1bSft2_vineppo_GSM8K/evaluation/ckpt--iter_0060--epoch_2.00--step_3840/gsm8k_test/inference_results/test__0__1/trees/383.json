She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. So, she spends 18 / 3 = $6 to make each pitcher of lemonade.\nEach cup of lemonade sells for $1, so each pitcher makes 4 * 1 = $4 in sales per hour.\nThus, she makes 4 - 6 = -2 dollars per hour in profit after paying her employees.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.765969309955835, "len_probs": 123, "answer": "\nMillie spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
