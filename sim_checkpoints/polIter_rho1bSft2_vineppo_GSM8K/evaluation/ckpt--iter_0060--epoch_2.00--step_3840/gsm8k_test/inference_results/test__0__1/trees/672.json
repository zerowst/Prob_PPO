Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good days and eight bad days and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 3 days, Christina had 3 days of good moods.\nIf Christina had 12 good days in the first 8 days, then she had 12 - 3 = 9 good days in the first 8 days.\nSimilarly, if Christina had 8 bad days in the first 8 days, then she had 8 - (3 + 1) = 4 good days in the next 3 days.\nSo in the next 3 days, Christina had 3 days of good moods.\nTherefore in the first 8 days, Christina had 9 + 4 + 3 = 16 days of good moods.\nIf Christina had 30 days in the month, then after the first 8 days, there were 30 - (16 days + 3 days) = 10 days left.\nSo Christina had 10 days of good moods in the month of March.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.881047323346138, "len_probs": 225, "answer": "\nIn the first 3 days, Christina had 3 days of good moods.\nIf Christina had 12 good days in the first 8 days, then she had 12 - 3 = 9 good days in the first 8 days.\nSimilarly, if Christina had 8 bad days in the first 8 days, then she had 8 - (3 + 1) = 4 good days in the next 3 days.\nSo in the next 3 days, Christina had 3 days of good moods.\nTherefore in the first 8 days, Christina had 9 + 4 + 3 = 16 days of good moods.\nIf Christina had 30 days in the month, then after the first 8 days, there were 30 - (16 days + 3 days) = 10 days left.\nSo Christina had 10 days of good moods in the month of March.\n#### 10\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first 8 days, Christina had 8 good days.\nIn the next 3 days, she had 3 good days.\nSo in the first 11 days, she had 8 + 3 = 11 days of good mood.\nOver the past 30 days, she had 12 days of good mood from the first 8 days and 8 days from the next 3 days, a total of 12 + 8 = 20 days.\nShe had neutral days in the next 3 days, so in the last 3 days, she had 3 days of neutral mood.\nIn the past 30 days, she had 20 days of good mood + 3 days of neutral mood = 23 days\nThe total number of days she had good mood is 11 + 23 = 34 days\n#### 34\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nChristina records her mood every day on a calendar.
