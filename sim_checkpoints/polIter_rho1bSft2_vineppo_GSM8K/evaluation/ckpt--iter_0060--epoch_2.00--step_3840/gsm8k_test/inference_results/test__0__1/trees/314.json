(number of players on the offense) - (number of players on the special teams)\nWe're given the expression 1.5* (number of players on the defense) = 105 - (number of players on the offense) - (number of players on the special teams), so we can substitute 105 - (number of players on the offense) - (number of players on the special teams) for 1.5* (number of players on the defense) in the equation above.\nThat gives us 105 - (number of players on the offense) - (number of players on the special teams) = 1.5* (number of players on the defense)\nWe know from the problem that 105 = (number of players on the offense) + (number of players on the special teams) + (number of players on the defense), so we can substitute that expression in for 105 in the equation above.\nThat gives us 105 - (number of players on the offense) - (number of players on the special teams) = (number of players on the offense) + (number of players on the special teams) + (number of players on the defense)\n20 = (number of players on the offense) + (number of players on the special teams)\nWe know from the problem that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so (number of players on the offense) = 2*(number of players on the defense).\nSubstituting that in, we get 2*(number of players on the defense) + (number of players on the special teams) = 20\nWe know from the problem that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so (number of players on the special teams) = (1/2)*(number of players on the defense).\nSubstituting that in, we get 2*(number of players on the defense) + (1/2)*(number of players on the defense) = 20\nCombining like terms, we get (3/2)*(number of players on the defense) = 20\nDividing both sides of the equation by (3/2), we get (number of players on the defense) = 20*(2/3) = 13.33\n#### 13.33\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.493414621800184, "len_probs": 758, "answer": "\nThere are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so there are 2* (number of players on the defense) = number of players on the offense.\nThere is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so there are (1/2)*(number of players on the defense) = number of players on the special teams.\nAll together, then, the number of players on the offense, the number on the special teams, and the number on the defense is (number of players on the offense) + (number of players on the special teams) + (number of players on the defense) = number of players on the defense + (number of players on the offense) + (1/2)*(number of players on the defense) = 1.5* (number of players on the defense)\nWe know the total number of players is 105, so we get the equation 1.5* (number of players on the defense) = 105 -
