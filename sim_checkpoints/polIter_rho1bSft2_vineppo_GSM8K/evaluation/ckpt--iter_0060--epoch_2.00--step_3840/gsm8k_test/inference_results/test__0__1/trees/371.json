On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?\n\nSolution:\nOn Saturday the store sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.\nOn Sunday they sold 28 * (2/1) = 56 pairs of shoes.\nOn Monday they sold (56/2) * (1/2) = 28 pairs of shoes\nIn total 14 + 28 + 56 + 28 = 140 pairs of shoes\nAfter the last day 6 pairs were returned, so the total number of shoes sold is 140 - 6 = 134.\n#### 134\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.665828555822372, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nOn Saturday the store sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.\nOn Sunday they sold 28 * (2/1) = 56 pairs of shoes.\nOn Monday they sold (56/2) * (1/2) = 28 pairs of shoes\nIn total 14 + 28 + 56 + 28 = 140 pairs of shoes\nAfter the last day 6 pairs were returned, so the total number of shoes sold is 140 - 6 = 134.\n#### 134\n"}]}
