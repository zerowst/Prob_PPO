While charging her friends\u2019 phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the initial capacity of the battery.\nAfter 5 hours, the battery lost 5*0.09*x = 0.45x\nAfter 5+3 = 8 hours, the battery lost 7% of the total capacity, so it lost an additional 0.07*x*3 = 0.21x\nThe total loss is 0.45x + 0.21x = 0.66x\nThe charge remaining is x - 0.66x = 0.34x\nWe know that after 8 hours, the charge was 28%, so 0.34x = 0.28x\nTherefore the initial capacity was x = 0.28x / 0.34 = 0.8\nThe battery had 8 hours to charge, so it had 0.8 * 8 = 6.4\n#### 6.4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.502574667334557, "len_probs": 213, "answer": "\nLet x be the initial capacity of the battery.\nAfter 5 hours, the battery lost 5*0.09*x = 0.45x\nAfter 5+3 = 8 hours, the battery lost 7% of the total capacity, so it lost an additional 0.07*x*3 = 0.21x\nThe total loss is 0.45x + 0.21x = 0.66x\nThe charge remaining is x - 0.66x = 0.34x\nWe know that after 8 hours, the charge was 28%, so 0.34x = 0.28x\nTherefore the initial capacity was x = 0.28x / 0.34 = 0.8\nThe battery had 8 hours to charge, so it had 0.8 * 8 = 6.4\n#### 6.4\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the initial capacity of the battery.\nAfter 5 hours, the battery lost 5*0.09*x = 0.45x\nAfter 5 hours and 3 hours, the battery lost 0.45x + 0.07*0.07x = 0.038x\nThe total loss is 0.45x + 0.038x = 0.488x\nThe initial charge was x - 0.488x = 0.512x\nThe battery charge when Maria went out to the park was 0.512x * 100% = 51.2%\n#### 51.2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMaria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn\u2019t fully charged yet.
