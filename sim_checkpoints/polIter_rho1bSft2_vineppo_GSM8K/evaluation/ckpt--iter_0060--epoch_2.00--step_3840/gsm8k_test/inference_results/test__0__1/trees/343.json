His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. If he took the coach's advice and trained for a month, what is the total distance he covered in June?\n\nSolution:\nTyson runs 1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters more every day.\nIn a month, there are 30 days. If he ran 1000 meters more every day, he would have covered 30 * 1000 = 30000 meters in a month.\nIf he ran 5000 meters every day for a month, the total distance covered is 5000 * 30 = 150000.\nIn a month, Tyson also ran the distance he covered in June, which is 150000.\nSo the total distance he covered in June is the distance he ran in a month, which is 150000.\nSo the answer is 150000.\n#### 150000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.088214084506035, "len_probs": 194, "answer": "\nTyson runs 1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters more every day.\nIn a month, there are 30 days.
