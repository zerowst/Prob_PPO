Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the amount of water in the small pool originally.\nAfter 4 minutes, the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool, so it has 2x.\nThe big pool has 4 minutes since 4 minutes ago, so it has been leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.\nThus, after 4 minutes, the big pool has leaked 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.\nNow the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so it has 2x + 16.\nAnd we know that 2x + 16 = 4x.\nThus, after 4 minutes, the small pool has 4x - 16 = 4(x - 4) = 4x - 16\nSo now the small pool has 4x - 16 gallons.\n#### 4x - 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.293386086821556, "len_probs": 208, "answer": "\nLet x be the amount of water in the small pool originally.\nAfter 4 minutes, the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool, so it has 2x.\nThe big pool has 4 minutes since 4 minutes ago, so it has been leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.\nThus, after 4 minutes, the big pool has leaked 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.\nNow the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so it has 2x + 16.\nAnd we know that 2x + 16 = 4x.\nThus, after 4 minutes, the small pool has 4x - 16 = 4(x - 4) = 4x - 16\nSo now the small pool has 4x - 16 gallons.\n#### 4x - 16\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the amount of water in the small pool originally.\nAfter 4 minutes, the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool, so it has 2x.\n4 minutes ago, the big pool had 4 gallons/minute * (4 minutes ago) = 32 gallons\nNow the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so it has 4x = 32\nx = 32 / 4\nx = 8 gallons\nThe small pool originally had 8 gallons, so now it has 8 + (4 * 8 gallons) = 8 + 32 = 40 gallons\n#### 40\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
