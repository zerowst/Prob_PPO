He owned 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land.\nSo he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from this.\nAltogether he earned 40 + 60 + 60 = $160.\n#### 160\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.22818833589554, "len_probs": 170, "answer": "\nAbraham sold half of his land for $50, so he earned 1/2 * 80 = $40.\nAfter a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
