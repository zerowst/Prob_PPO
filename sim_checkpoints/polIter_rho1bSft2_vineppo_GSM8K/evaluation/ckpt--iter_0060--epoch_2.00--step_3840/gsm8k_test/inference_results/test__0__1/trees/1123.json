If Kory\u2019s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory\u2019s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?\n\nSolution:\nElijah\u2019s dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory\u2019s dog, so it weighs 1/4 * 60 = 15 pounds.\nKory\u2019s dog is 60 pounds, so the second dog is 1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds.\nAltogether, Elijah and Kory\u2019s dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.\nAltogether, Elijah and Kory\u2019s dogs
