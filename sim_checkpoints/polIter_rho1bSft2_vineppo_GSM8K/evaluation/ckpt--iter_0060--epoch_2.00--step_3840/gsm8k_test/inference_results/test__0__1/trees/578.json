This gives us the equation:\n(y * (x - 12)) = (20 + (1/2)x) / 5 * (x - 12)\nWe can now solve this equation for x.\n(x - 12) = (20 + (1/2)x) / 5 * 5\n(x - 12) = (20 + (1/2)x)\nNow we can multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction.\n2(x - 12) = 2(20 + (1/2)x)\n2x - 24 = 40 + x\nNow we can subtract x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.\nx - 2x = 40 + 24\n-x = 64\nNow we can multiply everything by -1 to get x.\nx = -64\n#### 64\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nDiane gave a number train a starting value of 20.
