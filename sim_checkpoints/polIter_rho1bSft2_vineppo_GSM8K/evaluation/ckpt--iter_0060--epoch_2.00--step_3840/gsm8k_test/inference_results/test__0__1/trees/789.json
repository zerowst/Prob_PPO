To find how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to know how many degrees the house is above 32 degrees. We know that 78 degrees is above 32 degrees, so we have 78-32 = 46 degrees of heat left to distribute.\nEach log heats the house by 5 degrees, so we need to divide the total amount of heat needed by the amount of heat each log provides: 46 degrees / 5 degrees/log = 9.2 logs\nCarson needs 10 logs to distribute the heat, but since you can't have a fraction of a log, he needs 11 logs.\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.40713320299983, "len_probs": 205, "answer": "\nDuring the day it was 45 degrees and at night it was 33 degrees, so during the day and night it was 45+33 = 78 degrees.\nEach log heats the house up by 5 degrees.
