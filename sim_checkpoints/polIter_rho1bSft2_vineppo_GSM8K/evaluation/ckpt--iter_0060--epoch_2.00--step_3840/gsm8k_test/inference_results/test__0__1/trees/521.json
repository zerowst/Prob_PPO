How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday night, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nThis means that after completing 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday, Chris had 100 - 48 = 52 problems to complete on Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, he completed 1/4 of the remaining problems, so he completed 52 * (1/4) = 13 problems.\nThis means that after completing 13 problems on Wednesday, Chris had 52 - 13 = 39 problems to complete on Thursday.\nSo the answer is 39.\n#### 39\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.115068718791008, "len_probs": 183, "answer": "\nOn Monday night, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nThis means that after completing 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday, Chris had 100 - 48 = 52 problems to complete on Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, he completed 1/4 of the remaining problems, so he completed 52 * (1/4) = 13 problems.\nThis means that after completing 13 problems on Wednesday, Chris had 52 - 13 = 39 problems to complete on Thursday.\nSo the answer is 39.\n#### 39\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nThis is a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems.\nOn Wednesday, Chris completed 1/4 * 48 = 12 of the remaining problems.\nThus, after Wednesday, he had 48 \u2013 12 = 36 problems remaining.\nOn Thursday, Chris will complete 36 problems.\nSo, he will have 36 left on Thursday.\n#### 36\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nChris is way behind on his math homework.
