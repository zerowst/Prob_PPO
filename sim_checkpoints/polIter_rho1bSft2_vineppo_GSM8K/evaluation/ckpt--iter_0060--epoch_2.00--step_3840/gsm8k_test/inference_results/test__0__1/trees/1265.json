For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?\n\nSolution:\nTim needs 4 gallons of lemonade which is twice the amount of the other gallons, so 4 gallons * 2 = 8 gallons of lemonade\nFor 8 gallons, Tim needs 8 * 1 = 8 cups of lemon juice\nTim needs 8 cups of lemon juice for the recipe, but he needs 1 cup more because his recipe calls for 1 cup of juice per gallon.\nTim needs 8 cups + 1 cup = 9 cups of lemon juice\nTim needs 6 lemons per 1 cup of juice, so 9 cups of lemon juice * 6 lemons per cup = 54 lemons.\nTim needs 54 lemons.\n#### 54\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.621323883533478, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nTim needs 4 gallons of lemonade which is twice the amount of the other gallons, so 4 gallons * 2 = 8 gallons of lemonade\nFor 8 gallons, Tim needs 8 * 1 = 8 cups of lemon juice\nTim needs 8 cups of lemon juice for the recipe, but he needs 1 cup more because his recipe calls for 1 cup of juice per gallon.\nTim needs 8 cups + 1 cup = 9 cups of lemon juice\nTim needs 6 lemons per 1 cup of juice, so 9 cups of lemon juice * 6 lemons per cup = 54 lemons.\nTim needs 54 lemons.\n#### 54\n"}, {"text": "\nTim needs 4 gallons of lemonade that are 1 gallon each for a total of 4*1 = 4 gallons\nEach gallon requires 6 lemons so Tim needs 6*4 = 24 lemons\nTim wants to make an extra gallon for his friend that is twice as tart as the other gallons.
