To find out how long it takes Tim to get 2 miles, we need to convert the distance into feet because the speed is given in feet per minute. 2 miles = 2*5280 = 10560 feet.\nSo, it will take Tim 10560/264 = 40 minutes for Tim to get home.\nThe winner will be waiting for the loser, so the winner will be waiting 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.257003013044596, "len_probs": 222, "answer": "\nSteve's speed is 440 feet per minute.
