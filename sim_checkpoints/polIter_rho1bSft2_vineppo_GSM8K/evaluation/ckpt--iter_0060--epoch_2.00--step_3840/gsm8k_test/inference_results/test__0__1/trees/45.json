Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, so the total hours she spent on Monday is 4 hours/article x 5 articles = 20 hours.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles.\nSo on Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + 2 more = 7 articles.\nThus, the total hours she spent on Tuesday is 4 hours/article x 7 articles = 28 hours.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles.\nThus, the total hours she spent on Wednesday is 4 hours/article x 14 articles = 56 hours.\nSo the total number of hours she spent writing articles for the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104.\n#### 104\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.756065480411053, "len_probs": 224, "answer": "\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, so the total hours she spent on Monday is 4 hours/article x 5 articles = 20 hours.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles, so she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles.\nSo on Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + 2 more = 7 articles.\nThus, the total hours she spent on Tuesday is 4 hours/article x 7 articles = 28 hours.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles.\nThus, the total hours she spent on Wednesday is 4 hours/article x 14 articles = 56 hours.\nSo the total number of hours she spent writing articles for the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104.\n#### 104\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, and since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, she spent 4*5 = 20 hours on research and writing Monday's articles.\nOn Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5*5 = 2 more articles.\nThe total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = 7.\nIf each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, she spent 4*7 = 28 hours on research and writing articles on Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2*7 = 14.\nIf each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, she spent 4*14 = 56 hours on research and writing articles on Wednesday.\nIn the three days, she wrote 5+7+14 = 26 articles.\nThe total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20+28+56 = 104\n#### 104\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.
