The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?\n\nSolution:\nThe train goes 75 + 100 = 175 miles from the first city to the second city + the third city.\nSo the distance it travels between cities is 175 miles.\nThe distance it travels between cities is 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.\nSo the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 + 50 = 225 miles.\nIt does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles per day.\nThe train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it needs service every 18,000/675 = 26.67 days\nThe train needs service every 26.67 days so it goes between services 26.67 days.\n#### 26.67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.501074612140656, "len_probs": 211, "answer": "\nThe train goes 75 + 100 = 175 miles from the first city to the second city + the third city.\nSo the distance it travels between cities is 175 miles.\nThe distance it travels between cities is 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.\nSo the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 + 50 = 225 miles.\nIt does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles per day.\nThe train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it needs service every 18,000/675 = 26.67 days\nThe train needs service every 26.67 days so it goes between services 26.67 days.\n#### 26.67\n"}, {"text": "\nThe distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.\nThe distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.\nSo the distance from the third city to the first city is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.\nThis distance is traveled 3 times a day, so the total distance the train travels in one day is 3*125 = 375 miles.\nThe number of days the train needs service is the total distance divided by the service interval, so 375 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0208 days.\nTherefore, the train needs service every 0.0208 days, so it is 1 day between services.\n#### 1\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA train travels between 3 different cities.
