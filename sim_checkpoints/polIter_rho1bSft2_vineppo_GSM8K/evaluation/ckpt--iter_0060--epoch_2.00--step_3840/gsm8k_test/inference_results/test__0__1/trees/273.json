The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?\n\nSolution:\nThe body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes 900/10 = 90 stitches to complete the collar.\nThe rosette takes twice the number of stitches the collar takes, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.\nThe decorative rosette takes 180 stitches, so each sleeve takes 900 - 90 - 180 = 520 stitches.\nThus, each sleeve takes 520/2 = 260 stitches.\n#### 260\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.590002596378326, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nThe body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes 900/10 = 90 stitches to complete the collar.\nThe rosette takes twice the number of stitches the collar takes, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.\nThe decorative rosette takes 180 stitches, so each sleeve takes 900 - 90 - 180 = 520 stitches.\nThus, each sleeve takes 520/2 = 260 stitches.\n#### 260\n"}]}
