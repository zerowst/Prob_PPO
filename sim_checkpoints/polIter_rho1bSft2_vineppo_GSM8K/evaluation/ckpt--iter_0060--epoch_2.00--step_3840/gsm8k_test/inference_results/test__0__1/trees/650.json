At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?\n\nSolution:\nOn Tuesday, the pomegranates were bought at a total cost of 20 x $20 = $400.\nOn the following day, the price of each pomegranate was $30, so the total cost was 20 x $30 = $600.\nBut there was a discount of $600 x 0.10 = $60 after the voucher was used.\nSo the final price paid was $600 - $60 = $540.\nHence, the difference is $600 - $540 = $60.\nSo the answer is $60.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.12794592231512, "len_probs": 156, "answer": "\nOn Tuesday, the pomegranates were bought at a total cost of 20 x $20 = $400.\nOn the following day, the price of each pomegranate was $30, so the total cost was 20 x $30 = $600.\nBut there was a discount of $600 x 0.10 = $60 after the voucher was used.\nSo the final price paid was $600 - $60 = $540.\nHence, the difference is $600 - $540 = $60.\nSo the answer is $60.\n#### 60\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first day, the total cost for 20 pomegranates was 20 x $20 = $400.\nWith the voucher, on the second day, she paid 20 - 2 = $18 for each pomegranate.\nSo, on the second day Clara paid a total of 20 x 18 = $360.\nThe difference in the total cost between the two days is $400 - 360 = $40.\nThis is the amount of money Sheila saved with her discount.\nSo, the difference between the final prices was $40.\n#### 40\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
