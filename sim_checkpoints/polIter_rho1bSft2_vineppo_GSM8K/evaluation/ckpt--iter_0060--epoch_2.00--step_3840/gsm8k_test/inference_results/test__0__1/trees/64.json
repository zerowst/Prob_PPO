She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?\n\nSolution:\nSophia's car has a capacity of 12 gallons, and she used 4 gallons to fill her tank. This means she has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left in her tank.\nShe has been driving for 100 miles since her last fill-up, so she has been driving on 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\nThis means that her car's tank capacity is 25 miles per gallon, and she has 8 gallons in her tank.\nTherefore, Sophia can drive 8 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles on a single tank of gas.\n#### 200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.153716258704662, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nSophia's car has a capacity of 12 gallons, and she used 4 gallons to fill her tank.
