How much money would Cameron save?\n\nSolution:\nAfter 12 hours, Cameron would have paid 1000 pesos.\nThe cost of 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.\nThe total amount Cameron would have paid if he stayed 24 hours is 1000 + 1600 = 2600.\nIf Cameron stays an additional 1 hour, the cost is 70 pesos.\nThe total cost if he stays an additional hour is 2600 + 70 = 2670.\nTherefore, Cameron would save 2670 - 2600 = 70 pesos if he left at 5 pm instead of 10 am.\nSo Cameron would save 70 pesos if he left at 5 pm instead of 10 am.\n#### 70\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.816606745123863, "len_probs": 192, "answer": "\nAfter 12 hours, Cameron would have paid 1000 pesos.\nThe cost of 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.\nThe total amount Cameron would have paid if he stayed 24 hours is 1000 + 1600 = 2600.\nIf Cameron stays an additional 1 hour, the cost is 70 pesos.\nThe total cost if he stays an additional hour is 2600 + 70 = 2670.\nTherefore, Cameron would save 2670 - 2600 = 70 pesos if he left at 5 pm instead of 10 am.\nSo Cameron would save 70 pesos if he left at 5 pm instead of 10 am.\n#### 70\n"}, {"text": "\nCameron's stay would be 10 hours in total.\nIf he pays the 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, he would be charged 1000 for the first 12 hours and 0 for the additional hours.\nIf he adds 70 pesos for every hour after the first 12, he would be charged for the first 12 hours for 1000 + 70*9 = 1000 + 630 = 1630 pesos.\nThe total cost would be 1630.\nIf he pays the 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay, he would be charged 1600 for the first 24 hours.\nHe would be charged 70 pesos for every hour after the first 24 hours.\nThis means he would be charged for the first 12 hours 1000 + 70*2 = 1000 + 140 = 1140 pesos.\nThe total cost would be 1600 + 1140 = 2740 pesos.\nThe difference in cost is 2740 - 1630 = 1110 pesos.\nTherefore, Cameron would save 1110 pesos.\n#### 1110\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.
