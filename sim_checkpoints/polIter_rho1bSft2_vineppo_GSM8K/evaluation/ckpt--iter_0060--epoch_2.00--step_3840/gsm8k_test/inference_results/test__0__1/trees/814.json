How much money is used?\n\nSolution:\nJack's friends are significantly worse, so they each play for 1/2 * 20 minutes = 10 minutes.\nOne of his friends is significantly better, so they each play for 1.5 * 20 minutes = 30 minutes.\nThey all play for 4 hours, so in total they play for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.\nJack's friends played for 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.\nIn total Jack's friends played for 40 + Jack's 20 = 60 minutes.\nSo Jack played 240 - 60 = 180 minutes.\nJack played 180 / 20 = 9 rounds.\nSo he spent 9 * 20 = $180.\n#### 180\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.441033642739058, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nJack's friends are significantly worse, so they each play for 1/2 * 20 minutes = 10 minutes.\nOne of his friends is significantly better, so they each play for 1.5 * 20 minutes = 30 minutes.\nThey all play for 4 hours, so in total they play for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.\nJack's friends played for 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.\nIn total Jack's friends played for 40 + Jack's 20 = 60 minutes.\nSo Jack played 240 - 60 = 180 minutes.\nJack played 180 / 20 = 9 rounds.\nSo he spent 9 * 20 = $180.\n#### 180\n"}, {"text": "\nOne friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 20*1.5 = 30 minutes\nTwo friends are significantly worse than Jack, so they each play for 20*0.5 = 10 minutes\nJack plays for 20*4 = 80 minutes\nAll together they played 80+30+10+10 = 120\nThere are 4 hours per 60 minutes so 4*60 minutes in 1 hour\nThere are 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes in 4 hours\nThey played 120 minutes in 4 hours so they used 120/240 = 1/2 of an hour\nThey used 1/2 of an hour * $1 per hour = $0.50\n#### 0.50\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.
