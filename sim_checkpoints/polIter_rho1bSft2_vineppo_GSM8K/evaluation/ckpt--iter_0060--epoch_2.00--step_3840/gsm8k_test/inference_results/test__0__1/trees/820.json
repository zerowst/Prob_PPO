She also walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, to Hollock valley shores. Calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes.\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, she walked for 8 hours * (60 minutes/1 hour) = 480 minutes.\nOn the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day, so she walked for 1/2 * 480 minutes = 240 minutes.\nIn total, Sandy took 8 hours + 240 minutes = 8 hours and 240 minutes = 8 hours and 480 minutes in the two days.\nIn minutes, the total time is 480 minutes + 480 minutes = 960 minutes.\n#### 960\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.709181889891624, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
