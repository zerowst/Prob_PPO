The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, multiply the width by the length to find the volume of the pool in cubic feet: 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.\nThen multiply that number by 5.9 to find the volume in gallons: 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 836 gallons.\nThen multiply that number by the cost per gallon to find the total cost: 836 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $83.60.\nSo the total cost for filling the pool is $83.60.\nThat's how much it cost Mr. Smith to fill his pool.\n#### 83.60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.79596161097288, "len_probs": 167, "answer": "\nFirst, multiply the width by the length to find the volume of the pool in cubic feet: 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.\nThen multiply that number by 5.9 to find the volume in gallons: 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 836 gallons.\nThen multiply that number by the cost per gallon to find the total cost: 836 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $83.60.\nSo the total cost for filling the pool is $83.60.\nThat's how much it cost Mr. Smith to fill his pool.\n#### 83.60\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the pool.
