He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raises the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is 40+15=55 degrees.\nAfter 30 minutes of window open, the temperature drops by 2*30/60=1 degree.\nThe temperature after the window is open is 55-1=54 degrees.\nThen the temperature is lowered by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so it falls another 5*3/10=1.5 degrees.\nThe final temperature is 54-1.5=52.5 degrees.\n#### 52.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.555557139217854, "len_probs": 158, "answer": "\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raises the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is 40+15=55 degrees.\nAfter 30 minutes of window open, the temperature drops by 2*30/60=1 degree.\nThe temperature after the window is open is 55-1=54 degrees.\nThen the temperature is lowered by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so it falls another 5*3/10=1.5 degrees.\nThe final temperature is 54-1.5=52.5 degrees.\n#### 52.5\n"}]}
