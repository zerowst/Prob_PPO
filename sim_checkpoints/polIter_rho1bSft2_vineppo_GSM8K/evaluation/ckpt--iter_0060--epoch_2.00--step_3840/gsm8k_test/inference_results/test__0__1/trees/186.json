The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of rats is 10 cages * (number of rats per cage) = 10 cages * (number of rats per cage)\nThe total number of rats is also given by 6 pieces of straw per rat * total number of rats = 6 pieces of straw per rat * (total number of rats)\nThis is equal to 160 pieces of straw.\nSo the total number of rats is 160 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 26.66 rats\nThere are 10 cages per hamster so 26.66 / 10 = 2.66 cages per hamster\nTherefore the answer is 2 rats per cage\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.712673477828503, "len_probs": 182, "answer": "\nThe total number of rats is 10 cages * (number of rats per cage) = 10 cages * (number of rats per cage)\nThe total number of rats is also given by 6 pieces of straw per rat * total number of rats = 6 pieces of straw per rat * (total number of rats)\nThis is equal to 160 pieces of straw.\nSo the total number of rats is 160 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 26.66 rats\nThere are 10 cages per hamster so 26.66 / 10 = 2.66 cages per hamster\nTherefore the answer is 2 rats per cage\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nEach cage of hamsters has 10 cages * 6 pieces of straw per cage = 60 pieces of straw.\nThe pen of rabbits has 20 pieces of straw per rabbit * 0 rabbits = 0 pieces of straw.\nSo the total amount of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces + 60 pieces + 0 pieces = 220 pieces\nThere is a total of 220 pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents in 3 cages\nSo there is each cage holding 220 pieces of straw / 3 cages = 73.33 pieces of straw per cage\nThere are 73.33 pieces of straw per cage / 6 pieces per rat = 11.88 rats per cage\n#### 11.88\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRussell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents.
