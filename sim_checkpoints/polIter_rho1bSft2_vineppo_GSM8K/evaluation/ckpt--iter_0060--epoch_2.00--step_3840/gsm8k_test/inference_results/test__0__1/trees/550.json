So the discount is $29 x 10% = $2.9.\nSo Daniel has to pay $29 - $2.9 = $26.1.\nTherefore Daniel has to spend $26.1 in all.\n#### 26.1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.245879366993904, "len_probs": 190, "answer": "\nThe cost of five notebooks is $1.50 x 5 = $7.5.\nThe cost of two pens is $0.25 x 2 = $0.5.\nThe cost of one calculator is $12.\nAnd the cost of one geometry set is $10.\nSo the total amount Daniel has to spend on all the items is $7.5 + $0.5 + $12 + $10 = $29.\nDaniel has to spend $29, but the shop offers a 10% discount.
