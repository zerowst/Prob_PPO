He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he will be making 2x cookies this year.\nHenry baked 15 more than he intended, so his baking resulted in 2x + 15 cookies.\nHe dropped 5 of his cookies, so he now has 110 - 5 = 105 cookies.\nThis year\u2019s total is equal to the number of cookies he wanted to bake this year plus the extra 15, so 2x + 15 = 105.\nSubtract 15 from both sides of the equation, and you get 2x = 90.\nDivide both sides by 2, and you get x = 45.\nHenry baked 45 cookies last year.\n#### 45\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.836939185857773, "len_probs": 199, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he will be making 2x cookies this year.\nHenry baked 15 more than he intended, so his baking resulted in 2x + 15 cookies.\nHe dropped 5 of his cookies, so he now has 110 - 5 = 105 cookies.\nThis year\u2019s total is equal to the number of cookies he wanted to bake this year plus the extra 15, so 2x + 15 = 105.\nSubtract 15 from both sides of the equation, and you get 2x = 90.\nDivide both sides by 2, and you get x = 45.\nHenry baked 45 cookies last year.\n#### 45\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he will be making 2x cookies this year.\nHenry baked 15 more than he was supposed to last year, so he actually baked x + 15 cookies this year.\nHe bakes x + 15 cookies and then drops 5 cookies, so he has 110 - 5 = 105 cookies left.\nHe baked 2x and then dropped 5 cookies, so he has 105 = 2x - 5.\nAdding 5 to each side, we get 110 = 2x.\nDividing each side by 2, we get x = 55.\n#### 55\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nHenry is making cookies for a local baking competition.
