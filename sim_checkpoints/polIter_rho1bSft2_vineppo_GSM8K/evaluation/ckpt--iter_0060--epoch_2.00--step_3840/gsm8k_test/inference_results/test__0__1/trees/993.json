Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 flights = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the first plane takes 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 flights of its remaining flights to Germany.\nSo the first plane takes 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 flights per day to Greece.\nThere are 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.\nSo the first plane takes 2 * 2 = 4 flights to France in one day.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.087464198470116, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 flights = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the first plane takes 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 flights of its remaining flights to Germany.\nSo the first plane takes 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 flights per day to Greece.\nThere are 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.\nSo the first plane takes 2 * 2 = 4 flights to France in one day.\n#### 4\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 * 2 flights = 1.5 flights.\nThis means the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the first plane takes 2 flights - 1.5 flights = 0.5 flights in the other half of its flights.\nTherefore the first plane takes a total of 1.5 flights + 0.5 flights = 2 flights per day to Greece.\nSince the other plane takes only half the number of trips as the first plane, it takes 2 flights * 2 = 4 flights per day to Germany.\nThus the first plane takes a total of 4 flights per day * 44 trips = 176 flights per day.\n#### 176\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
