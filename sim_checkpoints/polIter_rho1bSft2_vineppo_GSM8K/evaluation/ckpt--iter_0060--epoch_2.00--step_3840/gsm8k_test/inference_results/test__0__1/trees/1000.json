How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we calculate how much time is spent on rounds. We multiply the number of inpatients by the time per inpatient: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.\nThen we add the time spent on appointments. We multiply the number of appointments by the time per appointment: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.\nNow we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.\nFinally, we divide this time by the number of hours in a day to find the number of hours: 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.\nDoctor Jones will be left with 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour to update his records.\nThis is the answer, so the final answer is: 1 hour.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.75498102977872, "len_probs": 220, "answer": "\nFirst, we calculate how much time is spent on rounds.
