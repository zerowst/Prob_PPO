If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?\n\nSolution:\nAva scored 10 points for each of the 8 more enemies she jumped on, so she scored 8 * 10 = 80 points.\nShe also scored 5 points for each of the 3 more berries she collected, so she scored 3 * 5 = 15 points.\nAva finished the level 4 seconds faster than Emma, so her score is 4 seconds less than Emma's score. If we let x be the score of Emma, then her score is x + 4.\nAva scored 80 + 15 + (x + 4) = x + 99.\nThus, Ava's score is 80 + 15 + (x + 4) = x + 99.\nCombining like terms, we get 99 = x + 99.\nThus, Ava's score is x + 99 = 99, so Ava's score is x = 0.\nEmma's score is x + 99 = 99.\nThus, the difference in their scores is 99 - 0 = 99.\n#### 99\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.912496387958527, "len_probs": 267, "answer": "\nAva scored 10 points for each of the 8 more enemies she jumped on, so she scored 8 * 10 = 80 points.\nShe also scored 5 points for each of the 3 more berries she collected, so she scored 3 * 5 = 15 points.\nAva finished the level 4 seconds faster than Emma, so her score is 4 seconds less than Emma's score.
