To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total cost to make 1 jar of the mixture: $6 + $8 + $10 = $24\nThen find the total cost to make 10 jars: $24/jar * 10 jars = $240\nThen find the total cost of the passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey: $2 * 2 + $1.5 * 1.5 + $2 * 2 = $24\nThen subtract that cost from the total cost to find how much profit he makes: $240 - $24 = $216\nThen divide that amount by the number of jars to find the profit per jar: $216/10 jars = $21.6\n#### 21.6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.839037880301476, "len_probs": 174, "answer": "\nFirst find the total cost to make 1 jar of the mixture: $6 + $8 + $10 = $24\nThen find the total cost to make 10 jars: $24/jar * 10 jars = $240\nThen find the total cost of the passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey: $2 * 2 + $1.5 * 1.5 + $2 * 2 = $24\nThen subtract that cost from the total cost to find how much profit he makes: $240 - $24 = $216\nThen divide that amount by the number of jars to find the profit per jar: $216/10 jars = $21.6\n#### 21.6\n"}, {"text": "\nTo make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey, for a total of 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 pounds per 10-jar mixture.\nThe cost for 10 jars of passion fruit is 10 * $6/pound = $60.\nThe cost for 10 jars of jackfruit is 10 * $8/pound = $80.\nThe cost for 10 jars of honey is 10 * $10/pound = $100.\nThus, the total cost for 10 jars is $60 + $80 + $100 = $240.\nThe profit for 10 jars is $50/jar * 10 jars = $500.\nThus Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the mixture is $500.\n#### 500\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim makes a special honey and jam mix.
