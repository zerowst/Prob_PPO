How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?\n\nSolution:\nDuring the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next day, he was not traveling, so he traveled 0 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day, so in total he traveled 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.\nAdding all this up, we get that Tom made a total of 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.\n#### 3140\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.930935382843018, "len_probs": 170, "answer": "\nDuring the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next day, he was not traveling, so he traveled 0 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day, so in total he traveled 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.\nAdding all this up, we get that Tom made a total of 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.\n#### 3140\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next day, he didn't travel, so he traveled 0 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so in total he traveled 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.\nAdding all the distances together, we get the total distance Tom traveled was 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers\n#### 3140\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
