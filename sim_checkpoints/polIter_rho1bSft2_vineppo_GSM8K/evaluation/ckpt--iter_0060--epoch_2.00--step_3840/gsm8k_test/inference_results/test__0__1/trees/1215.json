The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nThe number of red jelly beans is .9*.3=0.27\nThat means he guessed 900-0.27=899.73\nThe difference is 899.73 cubic inches\nThe volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches\nSo the difference is 899.73/540=1.65\nSo his guess was 1.65 off\n#### 1.65\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.172799840569496, "len_probs": 132, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nThe number of red jelly beans is .9*.3=0.27\nThat means he guessed 900-0.27=899.73\nThe difference is 899.73 cubic inches\nThe volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches\nSo the difference is 899.73/540=1.65\nSo his guess was 1.65 off\n#### 1.65\n"}, {"text": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches.\nThe number of red jelly beans is 900*.3 = 270 red jelly beans\nHe guessed that was 540*.15 = 81 cubic inches.\nSo he was off by 81-54 = 27 cubic inches.\nThat's 27/540*100% = 5% off.\n#### 5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.
