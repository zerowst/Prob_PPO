You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam\u2019s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?\n\nSolution:\nAdam\u2019s height is 40 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Adam\u2019s height is 4 feet 2 inches.\nHe grows 2 inches a year, so he will grow 4 feet 2 inches into 4 feet 2 + 2 = 4 feet 4 inches in height.\nThe roller coaster is 4 feet tall, so Adam will need to be 4 feet tall to ride it.\nThus, the number of years until he is tall enough to ride it is 4 feet 4 inches.\nTo convert this to years, we divide 4 by 12 to get the number of years in a decade.\nThus, 4 feet 4 inches = 4 + (4/12) years = 4.33 years.\n#### 4.33\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.819669671356678, "len_probs": 188, "answer": "\nAdam\u2019s height is 40 inches.
