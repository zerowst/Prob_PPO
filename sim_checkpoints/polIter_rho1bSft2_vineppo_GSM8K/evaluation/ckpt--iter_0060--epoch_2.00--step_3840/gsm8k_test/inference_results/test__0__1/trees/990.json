The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees an hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 2 degrees an hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 4 * 2 = 8 degrees.\nThus, after 3 hours of low-speed operation and 4 hours of high-speed operation, the air conditioner cooled 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe final temperature was the starting temperature - the temperature after the air conditioner ran for 3 + 4 = 7 hours.\nThat means the final temperature was 20 - 14 = 6 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.753607638180256, "len_probs": 167, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees an hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 2 degrees an hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 4 * 2 = 8 degrees.\nThus, after 3 hours of low-speed operation and 4 hours of high-speed operation, the air conditioner cooled 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe final temperature was the starting temperature - the temperature after the air conditioner ran for 3 + 4 = 7 hours.\nThat means the final temperature was 20 - 14 = 6 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 6\n"}, {"text": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 hours * 2 degrees per hour = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 4 hours * 2 degrees per hour = 8 degrees.\nThus, the total temperature after the air conditioner was turned on was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nAfter the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, it would have been 14 - 2*2 = 8 degrees lower.\n#### 8\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high.
