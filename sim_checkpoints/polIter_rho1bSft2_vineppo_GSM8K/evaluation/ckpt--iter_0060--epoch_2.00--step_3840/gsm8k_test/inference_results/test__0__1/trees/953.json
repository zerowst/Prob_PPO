How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So she woke up at 6 a.m. + 10 hours = 6 a.m. + 10/60 hours = 6 a.m. + 1/6 hour = 6.166666666666667 hours.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes of sleepwalking time.\nShe usually wakes up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. - 5 minutes = 10 p.m. - 5/60 hours = 10 p.m. - 1/12 hour = 10 p.m. - 51/60 hours = 10 p.m. - 51/60 * 60 minutes = 10 p.m. - 318 minutes = 10 - 318 = -308 minutes.\nSo she slept for 23 + (-308) = -285 minutes.\n#### 285\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.81947162002325, "len_probs": 293, "answer": "\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So she woke up at 6 a.m. + 10 hours = 6 a.m. + 10/60 hours = 6 a.m. + 1/6 hour = 6.166666666666667 hours.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes of sleepwalking time.\nShe usually wakes up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. - 5 minutes = 10 p.m. - 5/60 hours = 10 p.m. - 1/12 hour = 10 p.m. - 51/60 hours = 10 p.m. - 51/60 * 60 minutes = 10 p.m. - 318 minutes = 10 - 318 = -308 minutes.\nSo she slept for 23 + (-308) = -285 minutes.\n#### 285\n"}, {"text": "\nShe went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 6 a.m. that day, so she usually sleeps for 10+6 = 16 hours.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so she was awake for 2:38-2:15 = 23 minutes\nShe woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she usually woke up at 10:00-5 = 5:00 a.m.\nThat means she was awake from 5:00 a.m. to 2:15 p.m.\nSo she was awake for an additional 2:15-10:00 = 5 hours and 15 minutes\nShe usually sleeps for 16 hours, so she slept for 16+5 = 21 hours\nShe was awake for an additional 5 hours and 15 minutes, so she slept for 21+5+15 = 41 hours\nShe slept for 41 hours, so she slept 41 hours * 60 minutes = 2460 minutes\n#### 2460\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room.
