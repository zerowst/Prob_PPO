A shirt costs $7.50, a pair of pants cost $15, and socks cost $4.50 each if each team member buys the uniform items on their own. If they buy the items as a group, they are given a discount. A discounted shirt cost $6.75, a discounted pair of pants cost $13.50, and discounted socks cost $3.75. How much would their team of 12 save with the group discount?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of a shirt for 12 members is 12 x $7.50 = $90.\nThe total cost of pants for 12 members is 12 x $15 = $180.\nThe total cost of socks for 12 members is 12 x $4.50 = $54.\nThe total cost without discount for the shirt is 12 x $6.75 = $81.\nThe total cost without discount for the pants is 12 x $13.50 = $153.\nThe total cost without discount for the socks is 12 x $3.75 = $45.\nSo, without discount their team would pay 90 + 180 + 54 = $244.\nWith discount, the total price for the shirt for 12 members is 12 x $6.75 = $81.\nThe total price for pants for 12 members is 12 x $13.50 = $153.\nThe total price for socks for 12 members is 12 x $3.75 = $45.\nSo, with discount their team would pay 81 + 153 + 45 = 279.\nTherefore, their team would save 244 - 279 = $35.\nThe team would save $35 with the group discount.\n#### 35\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.627705931663513, "len_probs": 348, "answer": "\nThe total cost of a shirt for 12 members is 12 x $7.50 = $90.\nThe total cost of pants for 12 members is 12 x $15 = $180.\nThe total cost of socks for 12 members is 12 x $4.50 = $54.\nThe total cost without discount for the shirt is 12 x $6.75 = $81.\nThe total cost without discount for the pants is 12 x $13.50 = $153.\nThe total cost without discount for the socks is 12 x $3.75 = $45.\nSo, without discount their team would pay 90 + 180 + 54 = $244.\nWith discount, the total price for the shirt for 12 members is 12 x $6.75 = $81.\nThe total price for pants for 12 members is 12 x $13.50 = $153.\nThe total price for socks for 12 members is 12 x $3.75 = $45.\nSo, with discount their team would pay 81 + 153 + 45 = 279.\nTherefore, their team would save 244 - 279 = $35.\nThe team would save $35 with the group discount.\n#### 35\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total cost of a shirt at the regular store is $7.50.\nA discounted shirt at the group store costs $6.75.\nThe total cost of pants at the regular store is $15.\nA discounted pair of pants at the group store costs $13.50.\nThe total cost of socks at the regular store is $4.50 each.\nA discounted socks at the group store costs $3.75.\nThe total cost for the team members without the discount is $7.50 + $15 + $4.50\nThe total cost for the team members with the discount is $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75\nThe total cost for the team members without the discount is $17.\nThe total savings without the discount for the team members is $17 - $12\nThe total savings for the team members with the discount is $5.\n#### 5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEach member of Greg\u2019s softball team needs to buy one uniform made up of a shirt, a pair of pants, and socks.
