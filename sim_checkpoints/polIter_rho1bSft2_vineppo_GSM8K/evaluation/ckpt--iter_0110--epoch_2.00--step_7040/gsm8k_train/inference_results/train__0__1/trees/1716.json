Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount of students who paid the full amount was 25 - 4 = 21 students.\nThere was one set of 20 students who paid the full amount of $50, and one set of 1 student who paid 50 * 0.5 = $25.\nThe total amount for all the students who paid the full amount was 21 * 50 = $1050.\nThere were also another $25 from 4 students paying half, so in total the 4 students got 4 * 0.5 * 50\nThat is 4 * 25 = 100\nSo in total the class was able to gather 1050 + 100 = $1150.\n#### 1150\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.780816745013, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nThe total amount of students who paid the full amount was 25 - 4 = 21 students.\nThere was one set of 20 students who paid the full amount of $50, and one set of 1 student who paid 50 * 0.5 = $25.\nThe total amount for all the students who paid the full amount was 21 * 50 = $1050.\nThere were also another $25 from 4 students paying half, so in total the 4 students got 4 * 0.5 * 50\nThat is 4 * 25 = 100\nSo in total the class was able to gather 1050 + 100 = $1150.\n#### 1150\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total number of students in the class is 25.\nThey all paid the full amount of $50 except for 4 students.\nThis means the amount of the missing payments was $50 - (1/2) * $x\nThe total amount of missing payments was to the 21 students (25 - 4).\nSo, $50 - (1/2) * $x = $50 - $50 * (4/21)\nThis $50 * (1/2) * (21/4) = $175\nSo, the total amount was $50 - $175 = $-125\n#### 125\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIn Mary's class, there are 25 students.
