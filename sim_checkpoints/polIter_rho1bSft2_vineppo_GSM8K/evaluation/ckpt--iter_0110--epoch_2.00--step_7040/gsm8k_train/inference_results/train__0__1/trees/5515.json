She buys food for both of the animals for $30 in total a week. Julia has the rabbit for 5 weeks, and the parrot for 3 weeks. How much money did Julia already spend on food for her animals, if the weekly cost of the rabbit food is $12?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the rabbit food in weeks for Julia is 5 weeks, so $12/week x 5 weeks = $60.\nJulia also bought food for her parrot, but we don't know how many weeks she has had it for. Let's call this \"x\" weeks.\nThe total cost for the parrot food in weeks for Julia is x weeks, so $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) = total\nWe know that Julia bought food for the rabbit and the parrot for the same total amount, $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) = $30/week x total\nSubtracting the total for the rabbit food gives us: $30/week x total weeks for parrot - $12/week x total weeks for rabbit\nThis is: $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) - $12/week x (total weeks for rabbit)\nSubstituting the known values, we get: $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) - $12/week x (5 weeks for rabbit)\nWe can simplify this: $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) - $60/week (the total for rabbit food)\nSo, $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) = $60/week + $60/week\nSo, $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) = $120/week (total for parrot food)\nSo, $30/week x (total weeks for parrot) = $30/week x (total weeks for parrot)\nThis means that there's no money spent on parrot food because the total weeks for parrot is the same as for rabbit, so we can say:\nJulia already spent $0 on parrot food.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -59.23378077894449, "len_probs": 426, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the rabbit food in weeks for Julia is 5 weeks, so $12/week x 5 weeks = $60.\nJulia also bought food for her parrot, but we don't know how many weeks she has had it for.
