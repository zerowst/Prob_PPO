If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has a total of 12 + 7 + 0 (kitchens) = 19\nThere are 3 such structures, so the entire space station contains 3 * 19 = 57 rooms.\nThere are 72 - 57 = 15 kitchens in the entire space station.\nTherefore, there are 15 kitchens in each of the three cylindrical structures that make up the space station, and therefore 3 such space stations are needed to hold all the space.\nThis is because a space station is defined as a single unit, and a single unit is a collection of rooms.\nTherefore, 15 kitchens per space station * 3 space stations = 45 kitchens total.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.73112070560455, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has a total of 12 + 7 + 0 (kitchens) = 19\nThere are 3 such structures, so the entire space station contains 3 * 19 = 57 rooms.\nThere are 72 - 57 = 15 kitchens in the entire space station.\nTherefore, there are 15 kitchens in each of the three cylindrical structures that make up the space station, and therefore 3 such space stations are needed to hold all the space.\nThis is because a space station is defined as a single unit, and a single unit is a collection of rooms.\nTherefore, 15 kitchens per space station * 3 space stations = 45 kitchens total.\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and some number of kitchens.\nEach bedroom is shared by two other rooms, so the number of bedrooms that each structure has can be divided by 2.\nEach bathroom is also shared by two other rooms, so the number of bathrooms that each structure has can be divided by 2.\nEach kitchen is not shared by any other rooms, so it must be divided by 2 to be counted.\nTherefore, each cylindrical structure has 3 (two bedrooms/bathrooms) * 4 (two kitchens/bedroom) = 12 kitchens.\nThis means that the entire space station contains 3 * 12 = 36 rooms, which are kitchens.\nTherefore, there are 72 - 36 = 36 rooms that are not kitchens.\nThese 36 rooms are occupied by the 36 non-kitchen rooms on the entire space station,\nwhich means there are 36 / 3 (the number of each other rooms per space station room)\n#### 36\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.
