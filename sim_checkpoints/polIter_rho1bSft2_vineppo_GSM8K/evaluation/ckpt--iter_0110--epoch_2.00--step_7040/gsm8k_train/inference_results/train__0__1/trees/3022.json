Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?\n\nSolution:\nBess throws the Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters each = 80 meters.\nShe also throws it back 5 times * 8 meters each = 40 meters\nSo in total these are: 80 + 40 = 120 meters\nHolly throws the Frisbee 5 times * 8 meters each = 40 meters\nSo these are: 40 + 0 (because she leaves it where it lands)\nSo all 5 times she threw the Frisbee, it traveled 120 + 40 = 160 meters.\n#### 160\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.707352489233017, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nBess throws the Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters each = 80 meters.\nShe also throws it back 5 times * 8 meters each = 40 meters\nSo in total these are: 80 + 40 = 120 meters\nHolly throws the Frisbee 5 times * 8 meters each = 40 meters\nSo these are: 40 + 0 (because she leaves it where it lands)\nSo all 5 times she threw the Frisbee, it traveled 120 + 40 = 160 meters.\n#### 160\n"}]}
