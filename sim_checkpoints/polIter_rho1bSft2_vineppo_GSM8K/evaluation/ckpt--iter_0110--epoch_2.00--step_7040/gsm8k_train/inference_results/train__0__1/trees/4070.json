Tony has 2 packs of pens. There are 3 pens in each pack. If Kendra and Tony decide to keep two pens each and give the remaining pens to their friends one pen per friend, how many friends will they give pens to?\n\nSolution:\nKendra has a total of 4 x 3 = 12 pens.\nShe keeps 2 pens, so she gives 12 - 2 = 10 pens to her friends.\nTony has a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pens.\nHe keeps 6 - 2 = 4 pens, so he gives 4 / friends # of pens to friends.\n\n## 4\n#### 4\n</span>\n#### 4\n</span>\n```\n\nKendra and Tony together have 10 pens after giving some away. If they each keep one pen, they will have a total of 10 / 2 (since each of them keeps 2 pens), which is 5.\n\nThey will be able to give pens to 4 friends total because 10 / 4 = 2\n#### 4\n</span>\n#### 4\n</span>\n```\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n</span>\n#### 4\n</span>\n```\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n</span>\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n#### 4\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n#### 20\n```\n####", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -38.214930050075054, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nKendra has a total of 4 x 3 = 12 pens.\nShe keeps 2 pens, so she gives 12 - 2 = 10 pens to her friends.\nTony has a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pens.\nHe keeps 6 - 2 = 4 pens, so he gives 4 / friends # of pens to friends.\n\n## 4\n#### 4\n</span>\n#### 4\n</span>\n```\n\nKendra and Tony together have 10 pens after giving some away.
