She found that the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?\n\nSolution:\nThe sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B, so we can find the height of the sunflowers in Packet B by dividing the height of the sunflowers in Packet A by 1.2.\nSo, 192 / 1.2 = 160 inches\nThe sunflowers in Packet B were 160 inches.\nThe height of the sunflowers in Packet B is 160 inches.\nThis is the solution to the problem.\nAnother way to solve this problem is:\nIf the sunflowers in Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers in Packet B,\nWe can find the height of the sunflowers in Packet B by dividing the height of the sunflowers in Packet A by 1.2.\nSo, 192 / 1.2 = 160 inches\nThe sunflowers in Packet B were 160 inches.\nThis is because if x is 20% taller than y, we know that x = y + (20/100)y = (120/100)y\nThe height of the sunflowers in Packet B is 160 inches. The height of the sunflowers in Packet B is the answer to this problem.\nIt is also the answer to\n\u201cHow tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?\u201d\n\u201cThe sunflowers in Packet B were 160 inches.\u201d\nThe sunflowers in Packet B were 160 inches.\n#### 160\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -50.084326557815075, "len_probs": 371, "answer": "\nThe sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B, so we can find the height of the sunflowers in Packet B by dividing the height of the sunflowers in Packet A by 1.2.\nSo, 192 / 1.2 = 160 inches\nThe sunflowers in Packet B were 160 inches.\nThe height of the sunflowers in Packet B is 160 inches.\nThis is the solution to the problem.\nAnother way to solve this problem is:\nIf the sunflowers in Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers in Packet B,\nWe can find the height of the sunflowers in Packet B by dividing the height of the sunflowers in Packet A by 1.2.\nSo, 192 / 1.2 = 160 inches\nThe sunflowers in Packet B were 160 inches.\nThis is because if x is 20% taller than y, we know that x = y + (20/100)y = (120/100)y\nThe height of the sunflowers in Packet B is 160 inches.
