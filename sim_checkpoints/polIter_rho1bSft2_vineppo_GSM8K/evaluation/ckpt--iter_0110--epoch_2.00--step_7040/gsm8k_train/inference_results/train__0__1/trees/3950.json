How many miles did she run and walk in total?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to convert the time Ms. Warren ran from minutes to hours because her speed is given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so 20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 of an hour.\nSo, Ms. Warren ran at 6 mph for 1/3 of an hour, which means she ran for (1/3) (1) = 1/3 hours = 20 minutes\nHer speed was 6 mph, so she ran 6 (mph) = 6 miles\nNow we know that Ms. Warren ran a total of 1/3 hour for 20 minutes, we can convert that to hours because we know exactly (1/3) of an hour, so 1/3 of an hour\nTherefore, she ran for (1/3) of an hour\nHer speed was 6 mph, so she ran 6 (miles per hour) = 6 miles\nShe ran for 20 minutes, or 1/3 hour, so she ran 1/3 hour\nHer speed was 6 mph\nShe ran for 1/3 hours\nShe ran 6 miles\nThe total distance she ran was 6 miles.\nNext, we need to calculate how far she walked.\nMs. Warren walked at 2 mph for 30 minutes.\nThere are 60 minutes in one hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 1/2 of an hour.\nHer speed was 2 mph, so she walked 2 (miles per hour) = 2 miles per hour\nShe walked for 1/2 hour\nHer speed was 2 mph\nShe walked 1/2 hour\nShe walked 1/2\nThe total distance she walked was 1/2\nThe total distance she ran and walked was 6 miles + 1/2 miles\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -56.43427889049053, "len_probs": 429, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to convert the time Ms. Warren ran from minutes to hours because her speed is given in miles per hour.
