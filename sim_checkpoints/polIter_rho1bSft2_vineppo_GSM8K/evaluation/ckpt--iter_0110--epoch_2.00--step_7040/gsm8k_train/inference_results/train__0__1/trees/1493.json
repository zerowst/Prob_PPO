How many gallons of gas did they use?\n\nSolution:\nOn highways, the Jensen family drove 210 miles, and their car gets 35 miles for each gallon, so they used 210 / 35 = 6 gallons of gas.\nOn city streets, they drove 54 miles, and their car gets 18 miles for each gallon, so they used 54 / 18 = 3 gallons of gas.\nThe total amount of gas that the Jensen family used on their trip is 6 + 3 = 9 gallons.\nThe Jensen family used 9 gallons of gas in total during their trip. They drove a total distance of 210 miles.\nIf you want to know how many gallons you need to drive, you can use this formula:\nTotal gallons = Total miles / (miles per gallon on highways + miles per gallon on city streets)\nThe formula turns out to be:\nTotal gallons = 210 miles / (35 miles + 18 miles)\nTotal gallons = 210 miles / 53 miles\nTotal gallons = 3.95\nYou would need 4 gallons in total to drive 210 miles because 210 miles is greater than 18\n#### 9\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.631314378231764, "len_probs": 284, "answer": "\nOn highways, the Jensen family drove 210 miles, and their car gets 35 miles for each gallon, so they used 210 / 35 = 6 gallons of gas.\nOn city streets, they drove 54 miles, and their car gets 18 miles for each gallon, so they used 54 / 18 = 3 gallons of gas.\nThe total amount of gas that the Jensen family used on their trip is 6 + 3 = 9 gallons.\nThe Jensen family used 9 gallons of gas in total during their trip.
