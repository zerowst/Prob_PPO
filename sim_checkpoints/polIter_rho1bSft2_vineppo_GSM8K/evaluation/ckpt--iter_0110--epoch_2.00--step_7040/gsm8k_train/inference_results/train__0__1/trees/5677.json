he needs to make the batches\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1\n#### <\n#### 1", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -33.981093533337116, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nWallace already has 20 bags of jerky, so he needs to make 60 -
