The store also offers an installation service.  For $50.00 they will come to your house and professionally hang your curtains and prints.  If Emily agrees to this service, how much will her entire order cost?\n\nSolution:\nTwo pairs of curtains cost 2 x $30.00 = $60.00.\nNine wall prints cost 9 x $15.00 = $135.00.\nAnd the installation service cost $50.00.\nSo the total cost is $60.00 + $135.00 + $50.00 = $245.00.\n#### 245.\n#### \u201cTHIS IS AWESOME!
