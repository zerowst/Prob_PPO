During dinner time, they only ate one-fourth of it. The next day, Yves ate one-fourth of the remaining pizza. Then his two siblings ate 2 slices each. How many slices of pizza were left?\n\nSolution:\nDuring dinner time, they only ate 16 x 1/4 = 4 slices.\nSo there were 16 - 4 = 12 slices left.\nThe next day, Yves ate 12 x 1/4 = 3 slices.\nSo there were 12 - 3 = 9 slices.\nBoth of his siblings ate 2 x 2 = 4.\nSo there was left 9 - 4 = 5 slices for Yves to eat.\nThus, the remaining pizza's slices after Yves were not able to eat it, are 5.\nThere are 5 slices of pizza that were left.
