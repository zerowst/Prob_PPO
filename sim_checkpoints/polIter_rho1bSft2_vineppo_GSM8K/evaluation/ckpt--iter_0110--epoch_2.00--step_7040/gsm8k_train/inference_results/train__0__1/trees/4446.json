Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\n\nSolution:\nTo find out how long Janet has to wait, we have to calculate how long it takes for the sailboat to pass the point where Janet is driving.\nThe distance Janet has to travel is the lake's width, which Janet's sister can cover in less time.\nJanet's speed is 30 miles per hour, while Janet's sister's speed is 12 miles per hour.\nTo find out how long it takes Janet's sister to cover the 60 miles Janet is driving, we divide the total distance by their respective speeds:\n60 miles \u00f7 (12 miles/hour + 30 miles/hour) =\n60 miles \u00f7 (42 miles/hour) =\n1 hour\nJanet has to wait 1 hour for her sister to catch up. The time will be 1 hour when the sailboat is at the other side of the lake.\n#### 1\n<script>\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.421988274902105, "len_probs": 232, "answer": "\nTo find out how long Janet has to wait, we have to calculate how long it takes for the sailboat to pass the point where Janet is driving.\nThe distance Janet has to travel is the lake's width, which Janet's sister can cover in less time.\nJanet's speed is 30 miles per hour, while Janet's sister's speed is 12 miles per hour.\nTo find out how long it takes Janet's sister to cover the 60 miles Janet is driving, we divide the total distance by their respective speeds:\n60 miles \u00f7 (12 miles/hour + 30 miles/hour) =\n60 miles \u00f7 (42 miles/hour) =\n1 hour\nJanet has to wait 1 hour for her sister to catch up.
