He orders a steak and egg meal for $16.  He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the meal was $16 + the cost of the chicken fried steak was $14\nSo the total cost for all meals was 16+14 = $30\nJames' friend paid half of $30, so it was 1/2 * 30 = $15\nJames paid $15 - the cost of his portion of the chicken fried steak\nThat means he was paying 20% of the total cost of the other 3 meals\nSo his portion of the bill was 15 * (total cost he paid)\nSo if we let x be the total amount he paid\nWe have 0.2x = 15\nSo x = 75\nSo James paid $75 - $10 (the cost of his portion of the steak)\nSo James paid $65\n#### 65\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.07452193647623, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the meal was $16 + the cost of the chicken fried steak was $14\nSo the total cost for all meals was 16+14 = $30\nJames' friend paid half of $30, so it was 1/2 * 30 = $15\nJames paid $15 - the cost of his portion of the chicken fried steak\nThat means he was paying 20% of the total cost of the other 3 meals\nSo his portion of the bill was 15 * (total cost he paid)\nSo if we let x be the total amount he paid\nWe have 0.2x = 15\nSo x = 75\nSo James paid $75 - $10 (the cost of his portion of the steak)\nSo James paid $65\n#### 65\n"}]}
