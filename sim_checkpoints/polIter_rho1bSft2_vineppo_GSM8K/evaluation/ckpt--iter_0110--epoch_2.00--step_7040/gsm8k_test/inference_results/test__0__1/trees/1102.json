She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?\n\nSolution:\nSheila returned an item that originally cost $15.00, so she got a refund of 15 * (1/3 of the original price of the frying pan, because the original price of the frying pan was reduced by the sale\nShe got a refund of $15.00 * (1/3) = $5.00\nShe had a balance of $85.00 - $5.00 = $80.00 after she returned the $15.00 item.\nShe then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so the sale price was 20/100 * $20.00 = $4.00 less than the original price.\nThat means $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 was the price that she paid for the frying pan.\nShe also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00, so the sale price was 10/100 * $30.00 = $3.00 less than the original price.\nThat means $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 was the price that she paid for the towels.\nShe had a balance of $80.00 - $5.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $110.00\n#### 110\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.07490064203739, "len_probs": 348, "answer": "\nSheila returned an item that originally cost $15.00, so she got a refund of 15 * (1/3 of the original price of the frying pan, because the original price of the frying pan was reduced by the sale\nShe got a refund of $15.00 * (1/3) = $5.00\nShe had a balance of $85.00 - $5.00 = $80.00 after she returned the $15.00 item.\nShe then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so the sale price was 20/100 * $20.00 = $4.00 less than the original price.\nThat means $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 was the price that she paid for the frying pan.\nShe also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00, so the sale price was 10/100 * $30.00 = $3.00 less than the original price.\nThat means $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 was the price that she paid for the towels.\nShe had a balance of $80.00 - $5.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $110.00\n#### 110\n"}]}
