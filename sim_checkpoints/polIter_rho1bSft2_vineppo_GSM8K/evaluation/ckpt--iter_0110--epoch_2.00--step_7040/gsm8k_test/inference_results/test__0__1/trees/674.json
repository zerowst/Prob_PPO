In how many days will its height be 600 inches?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to convert the height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the question asks for the number of days. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so there are 12 * (20/12) = 240 inches in 20 feet.\nThe bamboo grows at 30 inches a day, so we\u2019ll use 600 - 240 = 360 inches to determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height.\nNext, we divide the total amount of inches the bamboo needs to grow (360) by the amount it grows in one day (30):\n360 \u00f7 30 = 12 days. 60\n\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.812789674848318, "len_probs": 186, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to convert the height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the question asks for the number of days.
