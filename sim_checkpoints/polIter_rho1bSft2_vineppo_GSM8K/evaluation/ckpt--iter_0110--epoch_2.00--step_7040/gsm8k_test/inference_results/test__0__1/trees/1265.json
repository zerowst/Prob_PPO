For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?\n\nSolution:\nTim needs 6 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice for his recipe. He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon makes 12 (4 x 3)\nThis means Tim will be making 3 sets of his 12-cup lemonade recipe that he makes from 6-cup lemon juice.\nEach set makes 12(3)=36 cups of lemon juice\nHe wants his extra gallon of lemonade to be twice as tart as the other gallons, so he wants 36 * 2 = 72 cups of lemonade\nSince 1 cup of lemon juice makes 1 cup of lemonade, he needs 72 cups of lemonade.\nHe needs 72 / 1 (cups of lemon juice per lemon) = 72 lemons\n#### 72\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.45049165934324, "len_probs": 209, "answer": "\nTim needs 6 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice for his recipe.
