He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?\n\nSolution:\nHe swam 2*0.6=1.2 miles\nSo he took 1.2/2=0.6 hours to cross the lake\nSo he took 0.6/2=0.3 hours to get the rest of the distance\nSo he took 0.3/2=0.15 hours to swim the rest of the lake\nSo in total, he took 0.15+0.6=0.75 hours\nHe took 1-0.5(the time for the 1st hour of rest)=0.5\nSo he took 0.75-0.5=0.25 hours for the remaining distance\nHe went 2*x=x\nSo he took x=0.1\nSo he took 1-0.5(the time for the 1st hour of rest)=0.5\nSo his final time was 0.25+0.5=0.75 hours\n#### 0.75\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.50382725149393, "len_probs": 223, "answer": "\nHe swam 2*0.6=1.2 miles\nSo he took 1.2/2=0.6 hours to cross the lake\nSo he took 0.6/2=0.3 hours to get the rest of the distance\nSo he took 0.3/2=0.15 hours to swim the rest of the lake\nSo in total, he took 0.15+0.6=0.75 hours\nHe took 1-0.5(the time for the 1st hour of rest)=0.5\nSo he took 0.75-0.5=0.25 hours for the remaining distance\nHe went 2*x=x\nSo he took x=0.1\nSo he took 1-0.5(the time for the 1st hour of rest)=0.5\nSo his final time was 0.25+0.5=0.75 hours\n#### 0.75\n"}, {"text": "\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nResting half the time of the swimming time, which is 60\nSo he rested for a 60/2=30\nThe time he spent swimming the 12 miles was a total of\nThe time of the swimming trip\nSo he must have had a total rest time of\nSo he must have spent 30+2\nSo the total time was\nSo the answer to the question is he spent 15\n#### 15\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJames loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.
