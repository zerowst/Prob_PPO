On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?\n\nSolution:\nOn the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\nOn the third day, they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.\nThey used 28 + 20 (from 100-pack) + 7 (leftover from 78)\nSo they had 128\nThey started with 128 + 1 = 129 on the first day.\n#### 129\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.490226790308952, "len_probs": 112, "answer": "\nOn the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\nOn the third day, they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.\nThey used 28 + 20 (from 100-pack) + 7 (leftover from 78)\nSo they had 128\nThey started with 128 + 1 = 129 on the first day.\n#### 129\n"}]}
