She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?\n\nSolution:\nThe soup was 25% more expensive than $4, so it was 4 * 1.25 = $5.\nThe cake was half the price of the bagel, so it was 4 / 2 = $2.\nSo the total cost for Aleksandra was: 4 + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = $11.\n#### 11.\n#### <span class=\"c1\">Aleksandra paid $11 for her dinner at the restaurant.\n</span>\n</body>\n####
