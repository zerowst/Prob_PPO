The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches.\nThe number of red jelly beans is 900*.3 = 270 red jelly beans\nHe estimates the volume of the jelly beans, so he should get an estimate of the number of red jelly beans around 80% of the time.\nSo 270 is a good estimate, so the difference is 900-270 = 630\nThat means his guess was 630 cubic inches\nThe volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches, so the jar is 540/6 = 90 cubic inches per volume\nThe volume of the jar is not the correct volume.\nThe correct answer is 90 cubic inches\n#### 630\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.413733303546906, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches.\nThe number of red jelly beans is 900*.3 = 270 red jelly beans\nHe estimates the volume of the jelly beans, so he should get an estimate of the number of red jelly beans around 80% of the time.\nSo 270 is a good estimate, so the difference is 900-270 = 630\nThat means his guess was 630 cubic inches\nThe volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches, so the jar is 540/6 = 90 cubic inches per volume\nThe volume of the jar is not the correct volume.\nThe correct answer is 90 cubic inches\n#### 630\n"}]}
