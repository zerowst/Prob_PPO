We are going to guess that there are 40 castles because 40 percent of something is a lot of things, and we are going to guess that there are a lot of unmanned ruins. We are going to guess 20 of them because 220 is 100, so 20 is a little less than 100, and we are going to make 20 castles the answer because they are unmanned and we are only going to guess. That is our answer, and it is the only answer that makes sense, because it is between 40 and 44.\nThe answer is 20 castles.\n#### 44\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 220 castles, so 40 percent of them, or 220 * 0.4 = 88 castles, are ruins.\nHalf of these castles are unmanned, so 1/2 * 88, or 44 unmanned ruined castles, in Scotland.\nThat\u2019s a lot of unmanned ruined castles. 44 castles.\nThat\u2019s a lot of unmanned ruined castles in one go.\nIt\u2019s easy to make a mistake in this kind of problem, so you have to make sure you\u2019re not missing anything by not checking the answer choices.\nYou can do this by checking the answer choices in two different ways.\nFirst, just because it\u2019s a lot of castles doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all unmanned.
