Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raises the temperature by 5*3 = 15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is thus 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.\nMarcus opens a window for 30 minutes, so the temperature drops by 2*30 = 60 degrees.\nThe temperature after the window is open is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\nThe temperature is then lowered further by 0.5*x, where x is the time in minutes the window was open.\nThis gives an additional 0.5*x*10 = x5 degrees.\nThe final temperature is 49 - x5 degrees.\n#### 49 - x5\n#### 49\n#### <\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n####", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -16.932416416704655, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raises the temperature by 5*3 = 15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is thus 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.\nMarcus opens a window for 30 minutes, so the temperature drops by 2*30 = 60 degrees.\nThe temperature after the window is open is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.\nThe temperature is then lowered further by 0.5*x, where x is the time in minutes the window was open.\nThis gives an additional 0.5*x*10 = x5 degrees.\nThe final temperature is 49 - x5 degrees.\n#### 49 - x5\n#### 49\n#### <\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n#### 49\n####"}, {"text": "\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven raises the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees\nSo the temperature after 3 hours is 40+15=55 degrees.\nThe window is open for 30/60=1/2 of an hour, so it raises the temperature by 5*(1/2)=5\nSo the temperature is now 55+5=60 degrees.\nThe house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so it cools down 30/6=5 times.\nSo the temperature is reduced by 5*2=10 degrees.\nThe final temperature is 60-10=50 degrees.\n#### 50\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
