In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?\n\nSolution:\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, who can pick 6 quarts per hour, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, who can thus pile 5 quarts per hour * (2), so Kathy can pile 5 * (2) = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nRicky can pick two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nTherefore, the four of them can pick in total per hour, 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 30 quarts of strawberries.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.253993012011051, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, who can pick 6 quarts per hour, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, who can thus pile 5 quarts per hour * (2), so Kathy can pile 5 * (2) = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nRicky can pick two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nTherefore, the four of them can pick in total per hour, 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 30 quarts of strawberries.\n#### 30\n"}, {"text": "\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, who can pick 6 quarts per hour, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, who can pick 5 quarts per hour, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, who can pick 10 quarts per hour, so Ricky can only pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.\nTherefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries they can pick per hour, in the order given, is 5 + 8 + 10 + 6 = 30 quarts.\n#### 30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIt's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.
