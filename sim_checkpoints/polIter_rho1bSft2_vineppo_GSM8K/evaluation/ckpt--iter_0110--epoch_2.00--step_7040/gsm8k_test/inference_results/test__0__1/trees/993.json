Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane flies 2 * 0.75 * (total flights) = 1.5 * total flights\nThe second plane flies (total flights - 1st plane's flights)\n44 / (total flights - 1st plane's flights)\nhalf the number of the 1st plane's flights: 44 / (total flights - 1st plane's flights) / 2\n2 * 1.5 * total flights = 44\ntotal flights = 44 / 3\nfirst plane takes 1 * total flights = 44 / 3 * 1/2 = 8 flights to France\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.844222754240036, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nThe first plane flies 2 * 0.75 * (total flights) = 1.5 * total flights\nThe second plane flies (total flights - 1st plane's flights)\n44 / (total flights - 1st plane's flights)\nhalf the number of the 1st plane's flights: 44 / (total flights - 1st plane's flights) / 2\n2 * 1.5 * total flights = 44\ntotal flights = 44 / 3\nfirst plane takes 1 * total flights = 44 / 3 * 1/2 = 8 flights to France\n#### 8\n"}]}
