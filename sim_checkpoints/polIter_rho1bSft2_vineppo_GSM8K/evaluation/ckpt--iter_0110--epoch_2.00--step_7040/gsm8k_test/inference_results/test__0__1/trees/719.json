and 4 sacks to her brother, if there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, how many kilograms does she gave to her cousin and brother?\n\nSolution:\nGoldy bought a total of 20 x 25 = 500 kilograms of rice.\nShe gave 3 + 4 (since 4 is more than 2, but less than 5, because 5 - 4 = 1)\nTherefore she gave away (3 + more, 3 less) of her total rice\nSo she gave away an equal amount (3 + more - 3 less) of her total rice\nThat would be (3+ more kilograms of rice)/(total less kilograms of rice)\nThat is (3+ more kilograms)/(4 less kilograms)\nLet x be the amount she gave to her cousin\nThe amount she gave to her brother = total - x\nTherefore (25x)/(5-x)= total amount\n(25x)/(5-x)= 500\n(25x)(5+x)/(5-x)= 500\n(25x+25x^2)/(5-x)= 500\n25x^2+50x-500=0\nx= 1\nThe amount she gave to her brother is
