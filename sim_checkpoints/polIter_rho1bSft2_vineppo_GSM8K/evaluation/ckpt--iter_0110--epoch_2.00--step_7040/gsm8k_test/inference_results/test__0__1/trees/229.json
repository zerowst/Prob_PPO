Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nThe number of ready melons after two months is 120 * 0.3 = 36.\nAfter Ashlyn went home two weeks later, there were 120 - 6 (she took home 6 melons that were not ready at first)\nThese 6 melons are (1/4) of the 48 that remained after she was away,\nSo 6 * (melon/4)\nWhich means there was 1 melon left not ready to be harvested\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.34176271781325, "len_probs": 119, "answer": "\nThe number of ready melons after two months is 120 * 0.3 = 36.\nAfter Ashlyn went home two weeks later, there were 120 - 6 (she took home 6 melons that were not ready at first)\nThese 6 melons are (1/4) of the 48 that remained after she was away,\nSo 6 * (melon/4)\nWhich means there was 1 melon left not ready to be harvested\n#### 1\n"}]}
