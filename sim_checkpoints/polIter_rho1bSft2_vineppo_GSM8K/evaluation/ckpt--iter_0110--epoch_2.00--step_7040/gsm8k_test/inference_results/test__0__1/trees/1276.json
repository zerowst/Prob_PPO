His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?\n\nSolution:\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) =\n2 * (35 feet) = 70 feet.\nJames needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.\nThe length of the crepe paper that James needs to buy is: (20 + x) feet, where x is the unknown value.\nSo the crepe paper for the entire fence = (20 + x) * (15).\nThat\u2019s a total of 70 feet. We can write this as:\n(20 + x) * (15) = 70.\nLet\u2019s expand the left side: 300 + 15x = 70.\nNow let\u2019s move 300 to the other side by subtracting 300 from both sides:\n15x = 70 - 300\n15x = -230.\nNow let\u2019s divide both sides by 15:\nx = -230 \u00f7 15.\nx = -15.\nThe value of x is -15. This means that the crepe paper length is 15 feet less than the actual fence length of 20 + x.\nThe correct answer is the length of the crepe paper that James needs to buy is (20 + x) * (15) =\n(20 - 15) * (15) =\n5 * (15) =\n75 feet.\n#### 75\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -69.23438236862421, "len_probs": 344, "answer": "\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) =\n2 * (35 feet) = 70 feet.\nJames needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.\nThe length of the crepe paper that James needs to buy is: (20 + x) feet, where x is the unknown value.\nSo the crepe paper for the entire fence = (20 + x) * (15).\nThat\u2019s a total of 70 feet.
