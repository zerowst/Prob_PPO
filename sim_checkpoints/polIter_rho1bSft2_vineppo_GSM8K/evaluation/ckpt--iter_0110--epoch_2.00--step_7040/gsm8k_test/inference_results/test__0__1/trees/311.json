If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?\n\nSolution:\nThree people eat three eggs each day, so they eat 3 x 3 = 9 eggs a day.\nThe rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat two eggs each day, so they eat 2 x 2 = 4 each day.\nSo the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs a day.\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the family consumes 13 x 7 = 91 eggs in a week.\nHence, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week. This is the answer we are looking for.\nWe can write it as: 5 x 7 (for the number of days in a week).\nThis is because the question asks about the number of eggs in a week.\nSo, there is a 5 x 7 = 35 in the answer\nThere is a big mistake in this solution. It should be:\n5 x 7\nThis is because the question asks about the number of eggs in a week.\nSo, there is a 5 x 7 = 35 in the answer.\n#### 91\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -47.66767208278179, "len_probs": 254, "answer": "\nThree people eat three eggs each day, so they eat 3 x 3 = 9 eggs a day.\nThe rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat two eggs each day, so they eat 2 x 2 = 4 each day.\nSo the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs a day.\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the family consumes 13 x 7 = 91 eggs in a week.\nHence, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.
