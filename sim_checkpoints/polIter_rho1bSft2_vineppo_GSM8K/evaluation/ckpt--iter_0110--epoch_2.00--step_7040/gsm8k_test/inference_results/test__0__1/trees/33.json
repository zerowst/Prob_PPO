How many gold coins does Gretchen have?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of silver coins.\nThe number of gold coins is x + 30.\nThe total number of coins is the number of silver coins plus the number of gold coins, which can be expressed as: x + (x + 30) = 110.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110.\nCombining the 2x terms, we get 2x = 80.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.\nThe number of silver coins is x = 40.\nThe number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.\nThere are 70 gold coins.\nThe number of the 70 gold coins is represented in the form of a single equation:\nx + (x + 30) = 110.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110.\nCombining the 2x terms, we get 2x = 80.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.\nThe number of silver coins is x = 40.\nThe number of gold coins is 1 x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.\nThe answer is the number of gold coins, 70.
