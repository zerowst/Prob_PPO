(He was short of $8)\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.88584325090051, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nOn Tuesday, he spent $8 x 2 = $16.\nOn Wednesday, he spent $16 x 4 = $64.\nThe total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $90.\nHe spent a total of how you want to know, $90\nHe was left with the difference between his original and final amounts.\n$100 - $90 = $10.\nHe was left $10 in total from $90 of spending.\nHe did not have enough money to spend on the other 10 because...\n$90 - $10 = $8\nHe would need to get another $8 in order to have enough money to spend on the other 10 of his spending.
