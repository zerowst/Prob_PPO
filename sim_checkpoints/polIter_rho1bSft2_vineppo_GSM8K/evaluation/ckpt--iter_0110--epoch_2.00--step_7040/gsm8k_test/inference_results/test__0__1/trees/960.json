How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?\n\nSolution:\nBy the end of the third day, the pirates had dug ten + thirteen + eight = 29 holes.\nThey had also dug a hole for every day they hadn't been digging after the three days when they were filling in holes. That's 3 days * 2 holes = 6 holes.\nSo by the end of the fourth day, they had 29 holes + 6 holes = 35 holes.\nThe island had 4 times as many holes as at the end of the first day, so the number of holes was 35 * 4 = 140 holes.\nThe pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure 140 - 1 (the hole they were filling) = 139 holes.\n#### 139\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.520129524171352, "len_probs": 180, "answer": "\nBy the end of the third day, the pirates had dug ten + thirteen + eight = 29 holes.\nThey had also dug a hole for every day they hadn't been digging after the three days when they were filling in holes.
