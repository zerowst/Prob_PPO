How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?\n\nSolution:\nJohn drinks 2 glasses of water during the weekdays, and he has a glass of water for dinner. He eats dinner 7 days a week, so for 7 days he drinks = 2 * 7 = 14 glasses of water.\nOn the weekends John drinks 2 glasses of water during the day, but not at dinner. Since John has a soda instead of a glass of water at dinner, he will not drink 2 glasses of water during dinner on the weekends.\nHe drinks 2 glasses of water during the weekend days = 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water.\nSo in total John drinks 14 + 4 = 18 glasses of water a week.\n#### 18\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.323691613972187, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nJohn drinks 2 glasses of water during the weekdays, and he has a glass of water for dinner.
