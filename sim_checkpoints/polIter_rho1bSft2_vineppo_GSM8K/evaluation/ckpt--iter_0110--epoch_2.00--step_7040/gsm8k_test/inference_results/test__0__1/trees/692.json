One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne crate of bananas costs 5 * 2 * (because one apple costs $0.5) = $10\nOne crate of oranges costs 2 * (because one banana costs twice as much as $10) * 7 = $24\nSo one crate of fruit (5 bananas + 12 apples + 7 oranges) would cost in total 10 + 24 = $34.\n#### 34\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.975314281880856, "len_probs": 106, "answer": "\nOne crate of bananas costs 5 * 2 * (because one apple costs $0.5) = $10\nOne crate of oranges costs 2 * (because one banana costs twice as much as $10) * 7 = $24\nSo one crate of fruit (5 bananas + 12 apples + 7 oranges) would cost in total 10 + 24 = $34.\n#### 34\n"}, {"text": "\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so each banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so each one costs 3 * the price of a banana per piece.\nSince we don't know the price of a banana yet, we can't calculate this yet.\nLet B be the price of a banana.\nSo, the price of an orange will be 3B.\nThe crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.\nThe total cost of the bananas in the crate is 5 * B = 5B.\nThe total cost of the apples in the crate is 12 * $0.5 = $6.\nAnd, the total cost of the oranges in the crate is 7 * 3B = $21B.\nSo, the total cost of the crate is $21B + $6 + 5B = $21B + $6 + 5B = $26B + $6.\n#### 26\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
