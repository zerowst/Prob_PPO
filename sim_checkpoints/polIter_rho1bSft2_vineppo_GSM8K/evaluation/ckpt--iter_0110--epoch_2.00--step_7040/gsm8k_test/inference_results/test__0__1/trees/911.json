He needs to complete more than 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.\nThis means that for each package he works, he receives $0.20.\nSo, in a typical eight-hour workday, he will earn 8 * $0.20 = $1.60 per hour.\nTherefore, Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday $1.60 x 10 (for a ten-hour difference in work completion), which is\n$16.\nThe money, $16, is earned by the following 8 hours of work:\n(8 hours * $1.60 per hour),\nwhich is $128\nThe additional amount, $16, is earned by\n(8 hours * $1.60 per hour) - (total hours in a typical 8-hour workday),\nwhich is $4\nThe money earned in the remaining 4 hours of a typical 8-hour workday is\n(4 hours * $1.60 per hour), which is $6.4.\nThe total money earned by Colby per typical eight-hour workday is:\n$16 + $6 =\n$22.\n#### 22\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -79.10391833260655, "len_probs": 294, "answer": "\nTo earn money, Colby needs to complete a certain amount of packages per hour.
