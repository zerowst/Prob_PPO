Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?\n\nSolution:\nThe old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting to dry, so for 6 paintings, it takes 6*7 = 42 minutes.\nThe new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting to dry, so for 6 paintings, it takes 6*12 = 72 minutes.\nThus, the new varnish takes 72 - 42 = 30 more minutes to dry than the old varnish\nThe difference in time is 30\nAnother way to say that is:\nthe new varnish takes 3 more minutes to dry than the old varnish\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n#### 3\n{{ \"3\" }}\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n</", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -22.432371236383915, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting to dry, so for 6 paintings, it takes 6*7 = 42 minutes.\nThe new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting to dry, so for 6 paintings, it takes 6*12 = 72 minutes.\nThus, the new varnish takes 72 -
