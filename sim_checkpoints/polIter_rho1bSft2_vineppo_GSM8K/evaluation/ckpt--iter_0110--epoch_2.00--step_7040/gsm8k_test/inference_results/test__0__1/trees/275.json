He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?\n\nSolution:\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.\nAnd the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\nSo, there are a total of 108 + 60 = 168 lines for the first two scenes.\nAnd 168 x 1/3 = 56 of those lines are his own.\nAnd there are 60 x 4/5 = 48 of the lines for the second scene that are his.\nSo he has to memorize 56 + 48 = 104 lines.\n#### 104\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.392598032951355, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.\nAnd the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\nSo, there are a total of 108 + 60 = 168 lines for the first two scenes.\nAnd 168 x 1/3 = 56 of those lines are his own.\nAnd there are 60 x 4/5 = 48 of the lines for the second scene that are his.\nSo he has to memorize 56 + 48 = 104 lines.\n#### 104\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first scene has 54 * 2 = 108 lines.\nThe second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\nThe second scene has 60 * 4/5 = 48 of his lines.\nSo, Sean has 108 + 60 + 54 (his lines for the first and second scenes) =\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 126\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 84\n####\n####\n#### 126\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 126\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n####\n#### 222\n####\n####\n#### 222", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.
