He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how much feed the horses will eat in total: 2 bags of carrots * (12 pounds/bag) = 24 pounds\nThen figure out how much feed the horses will eat in total: (4 bags of hay * (75 pounds/bag)) = 300 pounds\nThen figure out how much feed the horses will eat in total: (20 sacks of oats * (65 pounds/sack)) = 1300 pounds\nSo in total, the horses will eat 1+2+3+4 = 10\nSo the farmer needs to transport 5+1+1+1 = 8\nHe can fit all the feed on one trip because 2250/15 = 150\nSo the farmer needs 1 less trip because he needs to transport two more pounds than he has calculated.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.63881850242615, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how much feed the horses will eat in total: 2 bags of carrots * (12 pounds/bag) = 24 pounds\nThen figure out how much feed the horses will eat in total: (4 bags of hay * (75 pounds/bag)) = 300 pounds\nThen figure out how much feed the horses will eat in total: (20 sacks of oats * (65 pounds/sack)) = 1300 pounds\nSo in total, the horses will eat 1+2+3+4 = 10\nSo the farmer needs to transport 5+1+1+1 = 8\nHe can fit all the feed on one trip because 2250/15 = 150\nSo the farmer needs 1 less trip because he needs to transport two more pounds than he has calculated.\n#### 7\n"}]}
