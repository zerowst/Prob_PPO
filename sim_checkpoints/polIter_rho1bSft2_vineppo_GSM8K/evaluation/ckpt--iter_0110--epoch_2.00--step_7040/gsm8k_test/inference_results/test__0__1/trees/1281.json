Each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, how many pounds of feed is left after a week?\n\nSolution:\nEach pig eats 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds of feed every day.\nSo, all five pigs eat 8 pounds/day * 7 days = 56 pounds a week.\nTherefore, 300 - 56 = 144 pounds of feed is left after a week.\nThis amount can be further simplified:\n144\n--------\n7\n(Dividing by 4 to make it easier to see the 2's)\nSo, 7\n--------\n7\nis left as the remainder.\nThat is, 7 pounds of feed will remain after Dexter\u2019s pigs have eaten.\n#### 144\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n#### 7\n</Solution>\n</main>\n#### 7\n</Solution", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -47.67982538044453, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nEach pig eats 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds of feed every day.\nSo, all five pigs eat 8 pounds/day * 7 days = 56 pounds a week.\nTherefore, 300 -
