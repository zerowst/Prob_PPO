in an hour).\nSo, 0.02 Mb per second / (60 seconds / 1 hour) = 0.000333 Mb per hour.\nTherefore, Ashley\u2019s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 0.000333.\nThis can be written as 3.33 x 10^-4.\nSo, Ashley\u2019s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 3.33 x 10^-4.\nThe answer is 3.33 x 10^-4 (Mb per hour).\n#### 3.33 x 10^-4\n</Solution>\n#### 3.33 x 10^-4\n</Solution>\n####
