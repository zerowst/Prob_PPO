$2 = $18.\n#### 18.\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">\ud83c\udf89</span>\n#### <span class=\"badge badge-primary\">", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -17.352496668696404, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe cost of five notebooks is $1.50 x 5 = $7.5.\nThe cost of two pens is $0.25 x 2 = $0.5.\nThe cost of one calculator is $12.\nAnd the cost of one geometry set is $10.\nSo the total amount Daniel should pay for these items is $7.5 + $0.5 + $12 + $10 =\n$20.\nThe shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, so the discount Daniel gets is\n(10/100) x $20 = $2.\nSo Daniel has to spend $20 -
