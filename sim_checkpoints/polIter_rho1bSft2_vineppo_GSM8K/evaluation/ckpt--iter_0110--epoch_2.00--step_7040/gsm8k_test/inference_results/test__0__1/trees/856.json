He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?\n\nSolution:\nEach pack has 8 glue sticks, and Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, so he needs a total of 27 \u00f7 2 = 13.\nSince this is 14 less than a full pack, he will need to buy 14 / (8 - 1 of packs left over), which is 14 / (7 of packs left over),\nso Mr. Jackson needs to buy 1 pack of glue sticks, because 14 is less than 16, and 16 / 8 is a whole number.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.215874183923006, "len_probs": 138, "answer": "\nEach pack has 8 glue sticks, and Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, so he needs a total of 27 \u00f7 2 = 13.\nSince this is 14 less than a full pack, he will need to buy 14 / (8 - 1 of packs left over), which is 14 / (7 of packs left over),\nso Mr. Jackson needs to buy 1 pack of glue sticks, because 14 is less than 16, and 16 / 8 is a whole number.\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nEach pack has 8 glue sticks, and Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, so he needs a total of 27 / 2 = 13.\nThus, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 14 - 1 pack of glue sticks (as 2 packs are not enough), because 13 is not divisible by 8.\nTherefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 1 more pack of glue sticks, so he can give each student 2.\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMr. Jackson\u2019s fourth-grade class has 27 students.
