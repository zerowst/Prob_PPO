The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe eldest started with $18 - $5 (his share increased by $5) = $13\nThe next day he added another $10, so he had a total of $13 + $10 (from the previous day) = $23\nHe spent $8, so he was left with $23 - $8 = $15.\nHe then spent some money to make his total amount to be 3 * 15 = $45.\nThe amount left after saving some more money is $45\nHe tripled his remaining amount, so he is now $45 * 3 = $135.\n#### 135\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.23598186671734, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nThe eldest started with $18 - $5 (his share increased by $5) = $13\nThe next day he added another $10, so he had a total of $13 + $10 (from the previous day) = $23\nHe spent $8, so he was left with $23 - $8 = $15.\nHe then spent some money to make his total amount to be 3 * 15 = $45.\nThe amount left after saving some more money is $45\nHe tripled his remaining amount, so he is now $45 * 3 = $135.\n#### 135\n"}]}
