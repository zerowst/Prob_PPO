If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire needs to be replaced?\n\nSolution:\nJeremy drives 400 miles a month, and every 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times. So the car has to rotate 400/2=200 sets of 725 tire rotations to cover a distance of 400 miles.\nEach set of 725 tire rotations, the car needs to rotate 10,440,000 / 725 = 14,800 tire rotations to cover the distance of a monthly drive.\nIf every tire needs to rotate 14,800 times in a month, then the car will need to be replaced 148,000/1,044,000 = 1.4 years before the tire needs to be replaced.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.15119539946318, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nJeremy drives 400 miles a month, and every 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times.
