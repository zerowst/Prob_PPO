How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nA fifth of the jellyfish are large, so let's say there are a total of x jellyfish.\nSo 1/5 of x = the number of the large jellyfish\nThey are a fifth of the jellyfish that are x, so they are x/5 jellyfish.\nIf a third of the large jellyfish change color, they are now a third of the x/5 jellyfish that are\nThat means there are x/5 jellyfish that have changed color, which is the same as\nSo the total number of jellyfish is the number of the jellyfish that are x/5, which is x\nThere are 6 more blue jellyfish than the number of the jellyfish that are x/5\nSo the total number of jellyfish is x\nThere are 6 more blue jellyfish than the number of the jellyfish that are x/5, which is x\nSo the total number of jellyfish is the number of the jellyfish that are x/5, which is x\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.254953783005476, "len_probs": 235, "answer": "\nA fifth of the jellyfish are large, so let's say there are a total of x jellyfish.\nSo 1/5 of x = the number of the large jellyfish\nThey are a fifth of the jellyfish that are x, so they are x/5 jellyfish.\nIf a third of the large jellyfish change color, they are now a third of the x/5 jellyfish that are\nThat means there are x/5 jellyfish that have changed color, which is the same as\nSo the total number of jellyfish is the number of the jellyfish that are x/5, which is x\nThere are 6 more blue jellyfish than the number of the jellyfish that are x/5\nSo the total number of jellyfish is x\nThere are 6 more blue jellyfish than the number of the jellyfish that are x/5, which is x\nSo the total number of jellyfish is the number of the jellyfish that are x/5, which is x\n#### 6\n"}, {"text": "\nLet L be the number of large jellyfish, G be the number of green-colored large jellyfish, and B be the number of blue-colored large jellyfish.\nWe know that G = L/5 and B = (L/5)(1 + G/3).\nSo we can replace B in the equation with the expression above:\n6 = L/5 + L/5*G/3\n6 = L/5 + (L/15)G\nMultiplying through by 15, we get:\n90 = 3L + 5LG\n90 = 5L + 5LG\nWe can now substitute L with 6G - since we're looking for the total number\n90 = 5(6G - 1) + 5LG\n90 = 30G - 5 + 5LG\n90 = 30G + 5LG - 5\n90 = 35LG - 5\nWe now have a quadratic equation, which we can solve for L:\n90 + 5 = 35LG\n95 = 35LG\nDividing both sides by 35, we get:\n3 = LG\nSince we have 1 L and 3 G, we have:\n1 L = 3/G\nSo L = 3/G\nWe know that L = 6G - 1, so:\n6G - 1 = 3/G\nMultiplying through by G, we get:\n6G^2 - G - 3 = 0\nMultiplying through by -1, we get:\n6G^2 + G - 3 = 0\nWe can now factor this equation:\n(6G - 1)(G + 3) = 0\nSo G = 1/6 or -3.\nSince G can't be negative, G = 1/6.\nFrom L = 3/G, we have L = 3/(1/6) = 18.\nSo the total number of jellyfish is 6G + 1 = 6(1/6) + 1 = 7.\n#### 7\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it.
