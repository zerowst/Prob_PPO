Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\n\nSolution:\nThe probability that the normal teacher gives everyone an extension is 60%, and the probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment for a personal extension is 20%, so the probability of those two events happening is 60% * 20% = 12%.\nBut there's also a 50% chance that the substitute teacher won't come in, and 40% chance that she will give everyone an extension, so the probability that those two events don't happen is 30% * 60% = 18%.\nSo the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is 18% + 12% = 30%.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.930233601480722, "len_probs": 161, "answer": "\nThe probability that the normal teacher gives everyone an extension is 60%, and the probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment for a personal extension is 20%, so the probability of those two events happening is 60% * 20% = 12%.\nBut there's also a 50% chance that the substitute teacher won't come in, and 40% chance that she will give everyone an extension, so the probability that those two events don't happen is 30% * 60% = 18%.\nSo the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is 18% + 12% = 30%.\n#### 30\n"}, {"text": "\nThe chance of a normal teacher not collecting the homework is 100% - 50% = 50%.\nIf Marcus's normal teacher doesn't collect the homework, there's a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension.
