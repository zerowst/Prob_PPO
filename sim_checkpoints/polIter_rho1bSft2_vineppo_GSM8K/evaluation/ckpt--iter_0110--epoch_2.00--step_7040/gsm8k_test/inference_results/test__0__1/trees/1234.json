If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?\n\nSolution:\nIf 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina has written this year, we can find the total number of novels by dividing 9 novels / 3 (the fraction representing \"quarters\").\nThis gives 9 novels / (3/1) = 9 * (1/3) = 3 novels this year.\nTherefore Regina has written this year 3 novels. We can find this by dividing the 3 novels we found earlier by 1/1 (which is the same as saying \"we found 3 novels\nbecause we divided by 1/1 which is the same as multiplying by 1\").\nThis gives 3 novels / 1 = 3 novels this year.\nThis means we have found 3 = Regina has written this year.\nThe answer to this part of the question is 3.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -47.31389246508479, "len_probs": 202, "answer": "\nIf 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina has written this year, we can find the total number of novels by dividing 9 novels / 3 (the fraction representing \"quarters\").\nThis gives 9 novels / (3/1) = 9 * (1/3) = 3 novels this year.\nTherefore Regina has written this year 3 novels.
