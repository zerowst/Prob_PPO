Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total distance he was driving west: 5 hours * 18 mph = 90 miles\nThen find the total distance he was driving east: 8 hours * 18 mph = 144 miles.\nNow add those distances to find the total distance between where he started and where he ended up: 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles.\nNow subtract that distance from his starting distance to find how far he is now from his starting point: 234 miles - 18 miles (his total distance)\nThat gives 216 miles. So he is now 216 miles from where he began.\nThat's it, he's there now.\nThis problem is a good candidate for the \"difference of two squares\" formula, since it's a difference of two squares:\n(x+a)(x-a)=x^2-a^2\nHere, x is the distance from his starting point and a is 18.\nSo, (x+18)(x-18)=234\nExpand that and solve for x.\nx^2-18^2=234\nx^2-324=234\nx^2=558\nx=23 (since we're looking for the positive distance, negative or positive doesn't matter)\nSo he's 23 miles from his starting point or he's right at his starting point.\n#### 216\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -64.28393474966288, "len_probs": 336, "answer": "\nFirst find the total distance he was driving west: 5 hours * 18 mph = 90 miles\nThen find the total distance he was driving east: 8 hours * 18 mph = 144 miles.\nNow add those distances to find the total distance between where he started and where he ended up: 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles.\nNow subtract that distance from his starting distance to find how far he is now from his starting point: 234 miles - 18 miles (his total distance)\nThat gives 216 miles.
