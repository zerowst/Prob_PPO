How many kilometers farther did Cho hike?\n\nSolution:\nCho hiked 14 kilometers per hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers.\nChloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.\nCho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers more. That's how many more kilometers Chloe hiked than Cho.\nYou can find the difference in kilometers in many ways:\nCho's distance - Chloe's distance = 67\n112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.\nIt's 67 kilometers that Chloe hiked in total more than Cho. Or:\nCho hiked a 67 kilometer less than Chloe.\nThe answer is: Cho hiked 67 kilometers more than Chloe.\nThis is the same as: Cho hiked 1 hour more than Chloe.\nThat means that if Cho hiked for t hours, Chloe hiked for t + 1 hours.\nAnd in this case: 8 hours (Cho's time) < t + 1 (Chloe's time) < 5 (as they stopped at the same time).\n8 < t + 1 < 5.\nSubtract 1 from all three parts: 7 < t < 4.\nSo the only possible answer is: Cho hiked 1 hour more than Chloe.\nThis is true for example for t = 3: 8 < 3 + 1 < 5,\nwhich is true for example for t = 2: 8 < 2 + 1 < 5,\nwhich is true for example for t = 1: 8 < 1 + 1 < 5,\nwhich is true for example for t = 0: 8 < 0 + 1 < 5.\n#### 67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -96.13298416137695, "len_probs": 430, "answer": "\nCho hiked 14 kilometers per hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers.\nChloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.\nCho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers more.
