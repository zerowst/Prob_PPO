How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was turned off, so it did not cool the room any further.\nThe final temperature was 27 (room temperature + 6 from cooling at low for 3 hrs) + 12 (room temperature from cooling at high for 4 hrs) -\n3\n= 35 degrees\nThe final temperature was 35 - 27 = 8 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.10405445843935, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was turned off, so it did not cool the room any further.\nThe final temperature was 27 (room temperature + 6 from cooling at low for 3 hrs) + 12 (room temperature from cooling at high for 4 hrs) -\n3\n= 35 degrees\nThe final temperature was 35 - 27 = 8 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 8\n"}, {"text": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room at 3 - 2 = 1 degree an hour for the first 3 hours of low running.\nSo, the temperature was 1 * 3 = 3 degrees lower than the starting temperature after 3 hours of low running.\nThe air conditioner was turned on high for another 4 - 2 = 2 hours of running at 3\nSo, the temperature was cooled by 3 - 2 = 1 degree an hour for the first 4 hours of high running.\nSo, the temperature was 1 * 4 = 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature after 4 hours of high running.\nThe temperature was 3 + 4 = 7 degrees lower than the starting temperature after all running.\nThe final temperature was 7 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 7\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high.
