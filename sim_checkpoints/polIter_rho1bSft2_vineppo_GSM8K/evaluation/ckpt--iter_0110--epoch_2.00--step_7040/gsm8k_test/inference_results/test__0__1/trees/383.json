She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nEach pitcher makes 12 cups of lemonade.\nEach cup of lemonade makes $1.\nEach hour of running the lemonade stand, Millie makes 4 * $1 = 4.\nEach pitcher makes a profit of $4\nSo each hour of running the lemonade stand, Millie makes an average profit of $4 per pitcher of lemonade sold.\nTherefore, Millie makes an average profit of $4 per hour x $18 (total spent on supplies)\nThat is $72 per 6-hour workday\nSo the answer to this question is $4 per pitcher * (total sales / average sales per pitcher)\nThat = $4 * (4) / $1\nThat = $16 per hour\n#### 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.589877884835005, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nEach pitcher makes 12 cups of lemonade.\nEach cup of lemonade makes $1.\nEach hour of running the lemonade stand, Millie makes 4 * $1 = 4.\nEach pitcher makes a profit of $4\nSo each hour of running the lemonade stand, Millie makes an average profit of $4 per pitcher of lemonade sold.\nTherefore, Millie makes an average profit of $4 per hour x $18 (total spent on supplies)\nThat is $72 per 6-hour workday\nSo the answer to this question is $4 per pitcher * (total sales / average sales per pitcher)\nThat = $4 * (4) / $1\nThat = $16 per hour\n#### 16\n"}]}
