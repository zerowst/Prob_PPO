If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?\n\nSolution:\nEach cage has an equal number of rats and this number is known.\nEach cage has the same number of rats,\nwhich is the same as the number of straws per straw in a cage,\nso that the total number of straws in the cages is a multiple of the number of rats in a cage.\nIf there are n rats in a cage, and a total of M straws are distributed in the cages,\nthen M is equal to n*r, where r is the number of rats in each cage.\nIf 160 straws are distributed among the rats in the small cages,\nthen M = n*r = 3n.\nSo there are n = 160 / 3 straws in each cage.\n#### 56\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.94439160078764, "len_probs": 188, "answer": "\nEach cage has an equal number of rats and this number is known.\nEach cage has the same number of rats,\nwhich is the same as the number of straws per straw in a cage,\nso that the total number of straws in the cages is a multiple of the number of rats in a cage.\nIf there are n rats in a cage, and a total of M straws are distributed in the cages,\nthen M is equal to n*r, where r is the number of rats in each cage.\nIf 160 straws are distributed among the rats in the small cages,\nthen M = n*r = 3n.\nSo there are n = 160 / 3 straws in each cage.\n#### 56\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are a total of 10 cages of hamsters, which have a combined total of\nof 6 pieces of straw per rat x number of hamster cages\n= 6x10\n= 60 pieces of straw\nIf 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the small rodents\nThey are distributed among a total of\nof 5 pieces of straw per rat x total number of rats\n= 5x total number of rats\nThere is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits\nThere is a total of 20 pieces of straw per rabbit x total number of rabbits\n= 20 x\nThis means that the rabbit cage is\n= 2\nThere are 60 pieces of straw total in\ntotal number of rats x\n= 3\nThere is a total of 60 pieces of straw total in\ntotal number of rats x\n= 3\nTherefore each cage of rats has 60 pieces of straw / 3 cages of rats\n= 20 rats in each cage.\n#### 20\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRussell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents.
