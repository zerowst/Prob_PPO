1 leftover.\nThere were leftover, so the bakers have a leftover loaf.\nThe bakers\u2019 remaining loaf is 74 - 1 = 73.\nThey had 73 leftover loaves after selling 132.\n#### 73.\n#### 73\n#### 73\n</solution>\n</problem>\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n#### 73\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n```\n```\n#### 73\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -52.9067704603076, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe bakers sold 93 + 39 = 132 loaves of bread.\nThey had 200 -
