DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun and Richard has 5 guns. If they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of guns is 1 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 21 guns.\nIf they divide them equally, each person will get 21 / 4 (because there\u2019s 4 of them) = 5 guns.\nSo each of them would get to have a total of 5. That\u2019s the key to this problem:\n\u201cEach of them would get\u201d\nNot \u201cEach person would get\u201d.\nSo, the answer is 5.\nEach of them would get to have a total of 5.\nThe key to this problem is to realize that the total number of guns is shared equally among all four people.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to start with a number that can be divided by the number of people in the group (4 in this case).\nSo, we are looking for an answer that is a multiple of 4, like 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.\nThe key is that 5 is the only answer that is a multiple of all of the numbers (1, 10, 1, 5) because those are the numbers of the guns each person has.\nIf you have a different number of guns, you can\u2019t divide them equally among 4 people.\nSo the answer is:\n\u201cEach of them would get to have a total of 5 guns\u201d.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -79.43636777997017, "len_probs": 303, "answer": "\nThe total number of guns is 1 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 21 guns.\nIf they divide them equally, each person will get 21 / 4 (because there\u2019s 4 of them) = 5 guns.\nSo each of them would get to have a total of 5.
