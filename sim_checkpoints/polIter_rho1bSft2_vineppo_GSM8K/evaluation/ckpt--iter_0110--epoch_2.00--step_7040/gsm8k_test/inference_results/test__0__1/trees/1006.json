The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\nThey need to multiply it by 5.9 to find out how many gallons they need: 1400 x 5.9 = 796\nThe cost to fill the pool would be $796 x 0.10 = $79.6\nThe cost is $79.6. (x 0.10)\nThe total cost of filling the pool is the same as the total cost of the gallons of water.\nThe total is equal to the volume of the pool in gallons, 796\nThe total cost is the cost to fill the pool, $79.6\nTo fill the pool, it will cost to fill the pool.\n#### 79.6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -43.4343721345067, "len_probs": 187, "answer": "\nThe volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\nThey need to multiply it by 5.9 to find out how many gallons they need: 1400 x 5.9 = 796\nThe cost to fill the pool would be $796 x 0.10 = $79.6\nThe cost is $79.6.
