A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?\n\nSolution:\nThe car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60/2 = 30 miles/hour.\nThe car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour. If we assume the slow lane has a distance of x miles, the car in the slow lane would travel a distance of x at 30 miles/hour for a total time of\nx = 30*t\nWe know that the total distance was 480 miles, or 1 + 1/x\nSo we can create the equation\n1 + 1/x = 480\nSubtracting 1 from both sides we get\n1/x = 479\nMultiplying both sides by x we get\nx = 479\nSubstituting x for x in the first equation we get\n479 = 30*t\nDividing both sides by 30 we get\nt = 19\n#### 19\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.6994621604681, "len_probs": 233, "answer": "\nThe car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60/2 = 30 miles/hour.\nThe car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour.
