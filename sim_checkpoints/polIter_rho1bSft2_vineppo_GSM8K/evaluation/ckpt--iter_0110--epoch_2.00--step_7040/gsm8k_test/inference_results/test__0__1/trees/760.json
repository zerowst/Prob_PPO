How many people think that horse #12 will win?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find how many people think horse #2 will win: 50 * .2 = 10 people\nThis means there are 50 - 10 = 40 people who think horse #2 won't win.\nThen find how many of the 40 people think horse #7 will win: 40 * .6 = 24 people\nThis means there are 40 - 24 = 16 people who think horse #7 will win.\nSo the remaining number of people think horse #12 will win is the total number\nminus the 2 people who thought #7 won: 5 people\nTherefore 5 people think horses #12\nSo the answer to this problem is 5.  We are not told how many of the people who think horses #12 won, so we can not calculate the exact number for you.\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -43.87812579423189, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nFirst find how many people think horse #2 will win: 50 * .2 = 10 people\nThis means there are 50 - 10 = 40 people who think horse #2 won't win.\nThen find how many of the 40 people think horse #7 will win: 40 * .6 = 24 people\nThis means there are 40 - 24 = 16 people who think horse #7 will win.\nSo the remaining number of people think horse #12 will win is the total number\nminus the 2 people who thought #7 won: 5 people\nTherefore 5 people think horses #12\nSo the answer to this problem is 5.
