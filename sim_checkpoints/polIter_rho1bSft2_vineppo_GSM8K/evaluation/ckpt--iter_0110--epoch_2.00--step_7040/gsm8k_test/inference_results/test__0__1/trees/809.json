He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?\n\nSolution:\nDale started off with an order of 100 candies and ended up with an additional 100, for a total of 100+100 = 200 candies.\nDale sold 150 of those 200 candies, so he still has a total of 200-150 = 50 candies left to sell to make his total sales.\nSince he\u2019s only sold 100 candies to his customers so far, he needs to sell 50-10, or 4 more candies to reach his goal of having sold all his candy.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.457587152719498, "len_probs": 147, "answer": "\nDale started off with an order of 100 candies and ended up with an additional 100, for a total of 100+100 = 200 candies.\nDale sold 150 of those 200 candies, so he still has a total of 200-150 = 50 candies left to sell to make his total sales.\nSince he\u2019s only sold 100 candies to his customers so far, he needs to sell 50-10, or 4 more candies to reach his goal of having sold all his candy.\n#### 4\n"}]}
