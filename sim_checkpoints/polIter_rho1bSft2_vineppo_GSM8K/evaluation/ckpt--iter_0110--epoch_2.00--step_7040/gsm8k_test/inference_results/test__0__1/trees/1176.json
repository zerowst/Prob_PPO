Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used up 45% of the chalk, which means he used 5 * (20% of the chalk) * (1) because the piece of chalk was the same size on Monday as it was the previous day.\nThe 5 * (20% of the chalk) * (1) = 4.5\nSo the teacher has 4.5 days of chalk left to recycle before he needs to recycle a new piece because he can only use 20% of it.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.475968070328236, "len_probs": 120, "answer": "\nThe teacher used up 45% of the chalk, which means he used 5 * (20% of the chalk) * (1) because the piece of chalk was the same size on Monday as it was the previous day.\nThe 5 * (20% of the chalk) * (1) = 4.5\nSo the teacher has 4.5 days of chalk left to recycle before he needs to recycle a new piece because he can only use 20% of it.\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Monday, the teacher used a new piece of chalk, so we start with 0%\nHe used 45% of the chalk, so 15% of it was left\nOn Tuesday, the teacher used a piece that was 2 inches\nHe still has a piece that is 4 inches\nHe used 40% of it because 100-40=60\nHe has 4 more of these to use up\nSo he has to recycle this piece\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students.
