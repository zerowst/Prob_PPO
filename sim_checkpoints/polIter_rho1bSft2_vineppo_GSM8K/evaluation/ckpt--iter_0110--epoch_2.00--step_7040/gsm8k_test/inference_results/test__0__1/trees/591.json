The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?\n\nSolution:\nThe Dachshund weighed 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.\nAnd the Papillon weighed 1/4 * 20 = 5 pounds.\nAnd the Mastiff weighed 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.\nTherefore, the Mastiff weighed, in your terms, 220.\nSo, 220 is the answer,\n#### 220.\n#### <\n####  M\n####  <\n####  M\n####  <\n####  M\n####  <\n####  M\n####  <\n####  M\n####  <\n####
