He has 4 bags of nails to load, each of which weighs 5kg; he has 12 bags of hammers, each of which weighs 5 kg; he also has 10 bags of wooden planks, each of which weighs 30kg and can be sub-divided. He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?\n\nSolution:\nThe total weight of the nails is 4 x 5 = 20 kg.\nThe total weight of the hammers is 12 x 5 = 60 kg.\nThe total weight of the wooden planks is 10 x 30 = 300 kg.\nSo, the total weight for all the items Daryl wants to load is 20 + 60 + 300 = 420 kg.\nHe has 15 crates, so he could load them with 420 / 20 = 21 crates of nails, 2 crates of hammers and 1 crate of planks.\nHowever, he has 4, 5, and 3 bags of each of the items, so 4 x 3, 2 x 3, and 1 x 3\nAdding these bags, he has 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 bags of items.\nHe has 4 bags of nails, 1 of hammers and 1 of planks that weigh 5kg each, so he has 21 - 3\nHe will have to leave 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 items out of the crates\nEach crate can hold up to 20 kg, so 21 bags total weight is 21 * 20 = 420 kg\nIf he has 6 items he wants to leave out, he will have to leave 420 - 40 = 380 kg\nSo, Daryl is going to have to leave 380 / 2 = 190 kg of items\n#### 190\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -47.130529038608074, "len_probs": 385, "answer": "\nThe total weight of the nails is 4 x 5 = 20 kg.\nThe total weight of the hammers is 12 x 5 = 60 kg.\nThe total weight of the wooden planks is 10 x 30 = 300 kg.\nSo, the total weight for all the items Daryl wants to load is 20 + 60 + 300 = 420 kg.\nHe has 15 crates, so he could load them with 420 / 20 = 21 crates of nails, 2 crates of hammers and 1 crate of planks.\nHowever, he has 4, 5, and 3 bags of each of the items, so 4 x 3, 2 x 3, and 1 x 3\nAdding these bags, he has 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 bags of items.\nHe has 4 bags of nails, 1 of hammers and 1 of planks that weigh 5kg each, so he has 21 - 3\nHe will have to leave 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 items out of the crates\nEach crate can hold up to 20 kg, so 21 bags total weight is 21 * 20 = 420 kg\nIf he has 6 items he wants to leave out, he will have to leave 420 - 40 = 380 kg\nSo, Daryl is going to have to leave 380 / 2 = 190 kg of items\n#### 190\n"}]}
