Dusty buys 7 single layer cake slices and 5 double layer cake slices.  If he pays with a $100 bill, how much change does he receive?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the single layer cake slices is 7 * $4 = $28.\nThe total cost of the double layer cake slices is 5 * $7 = $35.\nThe total cost for both types of cake slices is $28 + $35 = $63.\nThe total amount of change Dusty receives is $100 - $63 = $37.\nTherefore, Dusty receives change of $37 after paying for the cake slices. He gives the cashier $100 (since $100 is the amount he paid).\nTherefore, the change was deducted from his account as 37 (change) - 0 (amount given) = 37.\n#### 37\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.563259553164244, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the single layer cake slices is 7 * $4 = $28.\nThe total cost of the double layer cake slices is 5 * $7 = $35.\nThe total cost for both types of cake slices is $28 + $35 = $63.\nThe total amount of change Dusty receives is $100 - $63 = $37.\nTherefore, Dusty receives change of $37 after paying for the cake slices.
