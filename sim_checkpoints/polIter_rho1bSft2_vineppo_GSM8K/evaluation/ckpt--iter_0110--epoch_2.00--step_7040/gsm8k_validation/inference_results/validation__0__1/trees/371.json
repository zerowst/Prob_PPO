So the total earning after the 6 months is 3*earning=earning\nThe earning is $3.\nThe coconut farming task is a 3-month project. So the total earning after the 6 months is 3*earning=earning\nThe earning is $3.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -43.924379486590624, "len_probs": 219, "answer": "\nThere are 2 coconut trees per square meter, so Rohan\u2019s farm has 2 * 20 = 40 coconut trees.\nEach tree has 6 coconuts, so there are 6 * 40 = 240 coconuts on his farm.\nAfter every 3 months, Rohan harvests his coconuts, so after 6 months, he will have harvested 6\nTherefore, Rohan will earn 6 * $0.50 = 3\nHe will earn $3\nThe coconut farming task is a 3-month project.
