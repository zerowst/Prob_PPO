Carson has to mow 40 lines to cover the whole yard, and it takes him 2 minutes to mow one line. He also needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, each with 7 flowers, and it takes him half a minute to plant each flower. How many minutes will Carson spend gardening?\n\nSolution:\nCarson needs to mow 40 lines, and each line takes 2 minutes to mow, so he needs to mow 40 * 2 = 80 minutes.\nCarson also needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, with each row having 7 flowers, so he needs to plant 8 * 7 = 56 flowers.\nCarson plants each flower with half a minute, so he needs 0.5 to plant each flower.\nThis means he will need 56 * 0.5 = 28 minutes to plant all the flowers.\nSo in total Carson will need 80 + 28 = 108 minutes to finish his gardening chores.\nThat is because 108 is the number of the 2-minute rests he will have after every 2\nminute stretch.\n#### 108\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.54817021638155, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nCarson needs to mow 40 lines, and each line takes 2 minutes to mow, so he needs to mow 40 * 2 = 80 minutes.\nCarson also needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, with each row having 7 flowers, so he needs to plant 8 * 7 = 56 flowers.\nCarson plants each flower with half a minute, so he needs 0.5 to plant each flower.\nThis means he will need 56 * 0.5 = 28 minutes to plant all the flowers.\nSo in total Carson will need 80 + 28 = 108 minutes to finish his gardening chores.\nThat is because 108 is the number of the 2-minute rests he will have after every 2\nminute stretch.\n#### 108\n"}, {"text": "\nCarson needs to mow 40 lines, and each line takes 2 minutes to mow, so he needs 40 * 2 = 80 minutes to mow the lawn.\nHe needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, each with 7 flowers, so he needs to plant 8 * (7 flowers per) = 56 flowers.\nIt takes him half a minute to plant each flower, so he needs 56 * (half) = 28 to plant the flowers.\nIn total, he will need to plant the flowers, Carson needs to do this task in 28\nHe needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, so he needs 8 * (the amount of time to do 1 flower)\nEach flower has a total of 7 flowers, so he needs 56 total\nHe needs to plant 28 flowers to do, so he needs a total of 28\nSo he is working 80 + the 28 minutes he needs to plant this amount of flowers\nSo he needs 88\n#### 88\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCarson needs to mow the lawn and plant some flowers.
