could have together is the number of the tulips they both have.\nIf it\u2019s not a problem, you can always add more flowers to the list.\nLet x be the number of flowers you can add to your combination.\nThe equation is:\nx + 60 = total number of flowers\nThe total is the sum of the flowers Arwen and Elrond picked.\nThe number of flowers they could have, with x, is 60 + x\nSo, Arwen and Elrond were able to get together 60 + x.\nYou can add the number of flowers you can add to the number they could have together.\nIf you don't have a specific number, you can say that they were able to get together x flowers in total, which is the number of the flowers you can add to the flowers they could have.\nFor example, if Arwen and Elrond were able to get together 70 flowers in total, then
