If he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, how many weeks will it take him to only drink 6 sodas per week?\n\nSolution:\nThe first step is to determine how many weeks it will take for him to reach the goal of drinking only 6 sodas a week, which is a reduction from 48 sodas per week to 6 sodas per week.\nTo figure this out, we divide 48 sodas per week by 2 sodas per week (half of what he currently drinks) to get:\n48/2=24\nSo it will take Jerry 24-weeks to get his sodas down to a total of 6 a week because you can't have a fraction of a week. (A week with 0 sodas is not a valid solution, so we're only considering weeks with a positive number of sodas.)\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -40.54061512649059, "len_probs": 166, "answer": "\nThe first step is to determine how many weeks it will take for him to reach the goal of drinking only 6 sodas a week, which is a reduction from 48 sodas per week to 6 sodas per week.\nTo figure this out, we divide 48 sodas per week by 2 sodas per week (half of what he currently drinks) to get:\n48/2=24\nSo it will take Jerry 24-weeks to get his sodas down to a total of 6 a week because you can't have a fraction of a week.
