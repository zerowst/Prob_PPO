The tickets cost $10.00 each.  They decided to get the large popcorn & 2 drink combo meal for $11.00 and each grab a box of candy for $2.50 each.  How much will Connor spend on his date?\n\nSolution:\nThe large popcorn & 2 drink combo meal cost $11.00.\nEach box of candy cost $2.50.\nSo, the total cost for the candy is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.\nTherefore, Connor will spend $10.00 + $11.00 + $5.00 = $26.00 on his date.\nThe cost for his date is $26.\nTherefore, he has to pay this amount in order to spend with his date because\nHe has no money or he is short of money.\nThis amount is the total amount of money he has to spend for his date.\nIt does not matter how much money he has because\nIt is not money that he has.\nHis money is not enough to pay for all the things he wants to do with his date.\nIt is not a sufficient amount to cover all the things he wants to do with his date.\n#### 26\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -48.633117970079184, "len_probs": 225, "answer": "\nThe large popcorn & 2 drink combo meal cost $11.00.\nEach box of candy cost $2.50.\nSo, the total cost for the candy is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.\nTherefore, Connor will spend $10.00 + $11.00 + $5.00 = $26.00 on his date.\nThe cost for his date is $26.\nTherefore, he has to pay this amount in order to spend with his date because\nHe has no money or he is short of money.\nThis amount is the total amount of money he has to spend for his date.\nIt does not matter how much money he has because\nIt is not money that he has.\nHis money is not enough to pay for all the things he wants to do with his date.\nIt is not a sufficient amount to cover all the things he wants to do with his date.\n#### 26\n"}]}
