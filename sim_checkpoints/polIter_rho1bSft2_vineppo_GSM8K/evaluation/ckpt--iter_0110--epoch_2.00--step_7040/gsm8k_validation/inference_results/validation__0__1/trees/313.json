His brother Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates than Nick hides. Last night, their mom found and took 5 chocolates from Alix. How many more chocolates does Alix have than Nick?\n\nSolution:\nNick hides 10 chocolates.\nAlix hides 3 * 10 chocolates = 30 chocolates.\nTheir mom takes 5 chocolates from Alix, so 30 - 5 chocolates = 25 chocolates.\nThe difference: Alix has 25 chocolates (that he found) (not counting the ones his mom took) (since you can't count the chocolate that was taken from him), and Nick has 10 chocolates. So Alix has 25 - 10 = 15 more chocolates than Nick.\nTherefore, after this, Alix has the 15 chocolates he has left.\n#### 15.\n#### 10\n#### 25\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 15\n#### 1", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -42.60000291466713, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nNick hides 10 chocolates.\nAlix hides 3 * 10 chocolates = 30 chocolates.\nTheir mom takes 5 chocolates from Alix, so 30 - 5 chocolates = 25 chocolates.\nThe difference: Alix has 25 chocolates (that he found) (not counting the ones his mom took) (since you can't count the chocolate that was taken from him), and Nick has 10 chocolates.
