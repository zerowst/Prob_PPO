A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models in total.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten library's dinosaurs was 2 x $100 = $200.\nThe school received a 5% discount on the $100 per model price, so the discount per model was $100 * 0.05 = $5.\nSo, the price for each model was $100 - $5 = $95.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $95 x 4 = $380 for the elementary library's dinosaurs.\nThe total amount the school paid for the dinosaurs from kindergarten and elementary libraries is $380 + $200 = $580.\n#### 580\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.35319311916828, "len_probs": 201, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models in total.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten library's dinosaurs was 2 x $100 = $200.\nThe school received a 5% discount on the $100 per model price, so the discount per model was $100 * 0.05 = $5.\nSo, the price for each model was $100 - $5 = $95.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $95 x 4 = $380 for the elementary library's dinosaurs.\nThe total amount the school paid for the dinosaurs from kindergarten and elementary libraries is $380 + $200 = $580.\n#### 580\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models in total.\nThe total cost for the kindergarten library's dinosaurs was 2 * $100 = $200.\nThe school got a 5% discount for each of the 4 additional models they bought, so each of them cost $100 - $100 * 5% = $100 - $5 = $95.\nSo the school paid a total of 2 * $95 = $190 for the kindergarten library's dinosaurs.\nThe total cost for all of the school's dinosaur models was $190 + $200 = $390.\n#### 390\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
