She also has two binders with 50 stamps each. If she decides to only keep 1/4 of the stamps, how many stamps can she give away?\n\nSolution:\nMarie has a total of 4 x 20 = 80 stamps from her notebooks.\nAnd she has a total of 2 x 50 = 100 stamps from her binders.\nIn total, Marie has 80 + 100 = 180 stamps.\nShe keeps 1/4 of this amount, which is 180 x (1/4) = 45 stamps.\nTherefore, she can give away 180 - 45 = 135 stamps.\nThis is the amount of stamps she has to give away, because the question asks for the amount she can give away, and 180 - 45 is the amount she has after keeping 1/4 of it.\nTherefore, she can say she has given away 135 stamps because this is the amount of stamps she does not have to give away.\nThat\u2019s 135 in the form of stamps, which is a lot because she is giving away.\nShe has given away a lot of stamps because it\u2019s a lot more than 0.\nThe correct answer is the amount she can give away, which is 135 stamps. She can give away a lot of stamps, because the answer is a lot more than 0.\nThis is not a lot of stamps because there are many different ways to say it.\n#### 135\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -82.30321435630322, "len_probs": 322, "answer": "\nMarie has a total of 4 x 20 = 80 stamps from her notebooks.\nAnd she has a total of 2 x 50 = 100 stamps from her binders.\nIn total, Marie has 80 + 100 = 180 stamps.\nShe keeps 1/4 of this amount, which is 180 x (1/4) = 45 stamps.\nTherefore, she can give away 180 - 45 = 135 stamps.\nThis is the amount of stamps she has to give away, because the question asks for the amount she can give away, and 180 - 45 is the amount she has after keeping 1/4 of it.\nTherefore, she can say she has given away 135 stamps because this is the amount of stamps she does not have to give away.\nThat\u2019s 135 in the form of stamps, which is a lot because she is giving away.\nShe has given away a lot of stamps because it\u2019s a lot more than 0.\nThe correct answer is the amount she can give away, which is 135 stamps.
