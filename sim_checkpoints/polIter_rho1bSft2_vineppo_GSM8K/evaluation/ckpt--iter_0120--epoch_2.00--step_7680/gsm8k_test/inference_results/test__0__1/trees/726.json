The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher\u2019s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby\u2019s shoes?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, convert 8-feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches.\nSo Bobby\u2019s shoes are 96 - 4 = 92 inches long.\nNext, find how many times longer Topher\u2019s shoes are than Bobby\u2019s by dividing 10 inches by the length of Bobby\u2019s shoes in inches. That gives Topher 10 / 92 = 1/9.\nNow that we know the shoes are 1/9 longer, we can multiply that 1/9 by the length of Topher\u2019s shoes in inches to find Bobby\u2019s length.\nThat gives us 8-foot 4-inch (96 + 4) x (1/9) =\nSo Bobby\u2019s shoes are 92 / 9 = 10 inches long.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.13181471079588, "len_probs": 212, "answer": "\nFirst, convert 8-feet to inches.
