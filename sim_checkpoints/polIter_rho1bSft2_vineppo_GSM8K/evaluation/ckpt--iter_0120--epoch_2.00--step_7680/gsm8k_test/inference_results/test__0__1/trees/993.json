Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each plane flies 1/2 * 2 in total,\nwhich means they each fly 4 trips in total.\nSo the first plane takes 44 trips in total, so the total number of flights it takes in one day is 2 + 1.5 + 4\nSo the first plane takes 7.5 flights in one day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 7.5 - 4 of French and German flights\nSo it takes 7.5 - 4 = 3.5 flights to France\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.87864851206541, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each plane flies 1/2 * 2 in total,\nwhich means they each fly 4 trips in total.\nSo the first plane takes 44 trips in total, so the total number of flights it takes in one day is 2 + 1.5 + 4\nSo the first plane takes 7.5 flights in one day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 7.5 - 4 of French and German flights\nSo it takes 7.5 - 4 = 3.5 flights to France\n#### 3\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3 / 4 * 2 = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so each has a total of\n2 flights\n(the remaining fraction of the first plane\u2019s total number of flights)\nSo the first plane takes 2 *\ntotal flights\nfor both countries = 2 * (total flights to France + total flights to Germany)\nIf the first plane only goes to Poland, it makes 1 / 2 *\ntotal flights\nto Poland, so we know that the first plane takes\ntotal flights to France +\ntotal flights to Germany\n= 2 * (total flights to Poland)\n44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day, so\nthe total number of flights to France +\ntotal flights to Germany =\ntotal flights to the first plane\nSo the first plane takes 2 *\ntotal flights to France +\ntotal flights to Germany =\ntotal flights to the first plane\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
