In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?\n\nSolution:\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, or 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, or 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, or 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, the total number of quarts per hour that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick is 6 + 5 + 10 + 8, which adds up to 31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -8.90491171181202, "len_probs": 159, "answer": "\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, or 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, or 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, or 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, the total number of quarts per hour that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick is 6 + 5 + 10 + 8, which adds up to 31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n"}, {"text": "\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, or 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, or 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, or (5 quarts per hour) - 2 quarts per hour = 3 quarts per hour.\nThus, the four pickers can pick a total of 6 + 5 + 10 + 3 = 24 quarts per hour.\n#### 24\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIt's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.
