That's the number of the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers, because you're looking from the end of the second hiker's trip to the end of the first hiker's.\nThe difference of the two speeds of the two hikers, because you're starting from the end of the second hiker's trip to the end of the first hiker's trip, is the same as the number of the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers.\nThis is the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers that you're looking at.\nThis is the difference of 67 kilometers.\nSo, this is the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers that you're looking at.\nThis is the number of the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers that you're looking at.\nThis is the difference of 67 kilometers.\nSo, Cho hiked 67 kilometers more than Chloe. That was the number of the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers that you're looking at.\nThe difference of 67 kilometers is the number of the difference of the two speeds of the two hikers.\n#### 67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -65.23078054562211, "len_probs": 358, "answer": "\nCho hiked 14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers.\nChloe hiked 9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.\nTherefore, Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers more.
