If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?\n\nSolution:\nAna spends 3 minutes per orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes per orange. So, they each spend the same amount of time per orange.\nAn hour has 60 minutes. So, if Ana and Jane pick at the same time for an hour, they will each pick for an hour/minute x (3 + 4)\nThat is (60/minute) x (3 + 4)\nThat\u2019s 60(7) = 420 oranges picked.\nSo, after an hour, Ana will be left with 420 - 400 = 20 oranges more than Jane.\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.53413290902972, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nAna spends 3 minutes per orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes per orange.
