How big is Peter's locker in cubic inches?\n\nSolution:\nZack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can find the size of Zack's locker by dividing the size of Timothy's locker by 2: 24 cubic inches / 2 = 12 cubic inches.\nPeter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can find the size of Peter's locker by multiplying the size of Zack's locker by 1/4: 12 cubic inches x 1/4 = 3 cubic inches.\nTherefore Peter's locker is that size.\nIt\u2019s not possible to have half as much as another person\u2019s locker size.
