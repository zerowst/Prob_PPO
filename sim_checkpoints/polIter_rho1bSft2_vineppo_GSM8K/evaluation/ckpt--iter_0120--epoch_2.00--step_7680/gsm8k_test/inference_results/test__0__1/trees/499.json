The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nSolution:\nThe first venue costs $200 regardless of how many guests attend.\nThe second venue charges $25 per person, and also charges for food, so the total cost would be $25 * (number of guests) + $5 (food cost per person).\nTo find out when the two venues cost the same, we want to set the first venue's cost equal to the second venue's cost:\n$200 = $25 * (number of guests) + $5\n$200 - $5 = $25 * (number of guests)\n$195 = $25 * (number of guests)\n$195 / $25 = number of guests\n7 guests go to the first venue to match the second venue, which has food included, at $25 per person.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.756858348846436, "len_probs": 192, "answer": "\nThe first venue costs $200 regardless of how many guests attend.\nThe second venue charges $25 per person, and also charges for food, so the total cost would be $25 * (number of guests) + $5 (food cost per person).\nTo find out when the two venues cost the same, we want to set the first venue's cost equal to the second venue's cost:\n$200 = $25 * (number of guests) + $5\n$200 - $5 = $25 * (number of guests)\n$195 = $25 * (number of guests)\n$195 / $25 = number of guests\n7 guests go to the first venue to match the second venue, which has food included, at $25 per person.\n#### 7\n"}, {"text": "\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200.\nFor the second venue, the cost is the number of guests x $25 per person.\nWe don't know how many guests, so let's call x the number of guests.\nWe also don't know how much food costs, so let's call that F.\nThe total cost for the second venue is 25x + F.\nThe total cost for the first venue is 200.\nSo, we can write: 25x + F = 200.\nWe also know that 5x + 25x (since food is included at the second venue) = F\nWe can combine these to get: 30x + 25x = F\nCombining like terms, we get 55x = F\nWe also know that 200 < 25x + F < 300\nSubstituting 55x for F, we get 200 < 55x < 300\nDividing by 55, we get 4 < x < 6/5\nSo, x is between 4 and 6/5, inclusive.\nTherefore, at least 6 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.
