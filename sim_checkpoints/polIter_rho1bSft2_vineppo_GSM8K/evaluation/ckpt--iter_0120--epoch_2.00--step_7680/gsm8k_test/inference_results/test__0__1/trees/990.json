The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 hours x 2 degrees per hour = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed up the room 4 hours x 2 degrees per hour = 8 degrees.\nSo, the room temperature after all was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was turned off 2 hours x 3 degrees per hour = 6 degrees higher than the starting temperature, but since it was off for 2 hours, it did not cool the room 6 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 - 0 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature, which is the temperature after all the other actions.\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.720591727644205, "len_probs": 157, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 hours x 2 degrees per hour = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed up the room 4 hours x 2 degrees per hour = 8 degrees.\nSo, the room temperature after all was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was turned off 2 hours x 3 degrees per hour = 6 degrees higher than the starting temperature, but since it was off for 2 hours, it did not cool the room 6 degrees.\nTherefore, the final temperature was 14 - 0 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature, which is the temperature after all the other actions.\n#### 14\n"}, {"text": "\nThe air conditioner cooled down 2*3=6 degrees in total at low settings.\nThe air conditioner increased the temperature by 3*4=12 degrees in total at high settings.\nTherefore, the final temperature was 2+12=14 degrees after the air conditioner was turned on and off.\nSo, the final temperature was 14-1 (the starting temperature)\nSo, the final temperature was 3 degrees lower than the starting temperature, which is the correct answer.\n#### 3\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high.
