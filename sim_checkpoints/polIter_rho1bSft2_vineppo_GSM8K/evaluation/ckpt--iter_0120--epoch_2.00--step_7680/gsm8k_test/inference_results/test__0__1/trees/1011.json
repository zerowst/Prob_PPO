On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, filling the tank with water, Wanda filled 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water.\nAnd Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda filled into the tank that day, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons of water.\nSo at the end of the first two days, the total amount of water in the tank was 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.\nOn the second day, the amount Wanda pumped was 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the first day, so it was 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water.\nAnd Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, so she pumped 1/3 * 4500 = 1500 gallons of water.\nSo the total amount of water by the end of the second day was 3000 + 1500 = 4500 gallons.\nIf we add the first 7875 to the second 4500, we get 7875 + 4500 = 12375 gallons of water in the tank.\nTherefore, the remaining amount of water to fill the tank should be 18000 - 12375 = 5625 gallons of water.\n#### 5625\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.515669509768486, "len_probs": 374, "answer": "\nOn the first day, filling the tank with water, Wanda filled 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water.\nAnd Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda filled into the tank that day, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons of water.\nSo at the end of the first two days, the total amount of water in the tank was 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.\nOn the second day, the amount Wanda pumped was 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the first day, so it was 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water.\nAnd Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, so she pumped 1/3 * 4500 = 1500 gallons of water.\nSo the total amount of water by the end of the second day was 3000 + 1500 = 4500 gallons.\nIf we add the first 7875 to the second 4500, we get 7875 + 4500 = 12375 gallons of water in the tank.\nTherefore, the remaining amount of water to fill the tank should be 18000 - 12375 = 5625 gallons of water.\n#### 5625\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first day, filling the tank with water, Wanda filled 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water.\nAnd Ms. B pumped 3/4 * of what Wanda pumped on the first day, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3250 gallons of water.\nSo after two days, there were 18000 - (4500 + 3250)\nThere were 18000 - 7750 = 10250 gallons left\nOn the second day, Wanda filled 2/3 * (the amount of gallons she pumped the previous day), which we'll call x\nShe also pumped 1/3 * the amount of gallons Wanda pumped the first day.\nThat means she pumped 2/3 * x = the amount of gallons on the second day\nWe also know she pumped 4\nSo the total amount of gallons Wanda pumped was x + 4\nWe can now set up an equation:\n2/3 * x + 4 + 1/3 * x = 10250\nSolving the equation gives x = 6000 gallons.\nSo 10250 - 6000 = 4250 gallons remain\n#### 4250\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons.
