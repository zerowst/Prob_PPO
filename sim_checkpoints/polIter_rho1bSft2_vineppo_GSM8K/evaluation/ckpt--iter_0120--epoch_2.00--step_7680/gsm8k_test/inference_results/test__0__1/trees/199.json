He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?\n\nSolution:\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, and we know from the problem that Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence, Publisher B pays Mark a total of 2 * $0.05 = $0.10 per sentence.\nMark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him $0.05 per sentence, so he gets 1000 * $0.05 = $50.00 from Publisher A in one week.\nMark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher B pays him $0.10 per sentence, so he gets 1000 * $0.10 = $100.00 from Publisher B in one week.\nIn total, Mark makes $50.00 + $100.00 = $150.00 in one week.\nThus he is paid in cents, so the answer is 150 * 100 = 15000.\n#### 15000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.787890374660492, "len_probs": 252, "answer": "\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, and we know from the problem that Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence, Publisher B pays Mark a total of 2 * $0.05 = $0.10 per sentence.\nMark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him $0.05 per sentence, so he gets 1000 * $0.05 = $50.00 from Publisher A in one week.\nMark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher B pays him $0.10 per sentence, so he gets 1000 * $0.10 = $100.00 from Publisher B in one week.\nIn total, Mark makes $50.00 + $100.00 = $150.00 in one week.\nThus he is paid in cents, so the answer is 150 * 100 = 15000.\n#### 15000\n"}, {"text": "\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, this means that Publisher B pays Mark 2 * $0.05 = $0.10 per sentence.\nMark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he gets 1000 sentences * $0.05 = $50 from Publisher A in a week.\nPublisher B pays Mark $0.10 per sentence, so he gets 1000 sentences * $0.10 = $100 from Publisher B in a week.\nTherefore, Mark makes $50 + $100 = $150 in a week.\nConverting this to cents we get $150 * 100 = 15000 cents.\n#### 15000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is a copy-editor.
