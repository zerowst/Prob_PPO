Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 12 inches in 1 foot so 111 feet x (12 inches/foot)= 1332 inches in the flower bed.\nPat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. There are 1332 inches / 1.5 feet = 924 spaces between each set of plants.\nPat owns 17 flowers so if we subtract the spaces between the flowers she will have\n924 spaces - 17 flowers = 894 spaces between flowers that need to be filled\nIf each flower needs 12 inches, 894 spaces x 12 inches = 11,744 inches between all the flowers.\nIf each flower needs to be $6, 11,744 inches x $6 = $69,44\n#### 6944\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.257562704384327, "len_probs": 190, "answer": "\nThere are 12 inches in 1 foot so 111 feet x (12 inches/foot)= 1332 inches in the flower bed.\nPat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
