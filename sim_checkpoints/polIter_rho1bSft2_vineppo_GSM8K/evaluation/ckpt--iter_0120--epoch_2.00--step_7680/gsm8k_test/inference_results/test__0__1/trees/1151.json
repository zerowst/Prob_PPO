If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?\n\nSolution:\nThe total distance traveled is 110 + 140 = 250 miles.\nThe total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\nThe average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, so 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\nThe average speed is 50 miles per hour.\nThe average speed is 50 mph.\nSo the answer to this question is it's the average speed of 50 miles per hour.\nIf you're looking for a number that's the average of a set of numbers, it's a number that you get when you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. You can also say that the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time taken to travel that distance.\nThe average speed of the car is 50 mph.\nThe average speed is 50 miles per hour.\nThis is the average of the two speeds, so it\u2019s the average of the two numbers in the problem.\nThe average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.\nThere\u2019s another way to find the average of 2 speeds, which is the total distance divided by the total time.\nThe total distance is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.\nThe total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\nThe average speed of the car is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -70.36846975237131, "len_probs": 347, "answer": "\nThe total distance traveled is 110 + 140 = 250 miles.\nThe total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\nThe average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, so 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\nThe average speed is 50 miles per hour.\nThe average speed is 50 mph.\nSo the answer to this question is it's the average speed of 50 miles per hour.\nIf you're looking for a number that's the average of a set of numbers, it's a number that you get when you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are.
