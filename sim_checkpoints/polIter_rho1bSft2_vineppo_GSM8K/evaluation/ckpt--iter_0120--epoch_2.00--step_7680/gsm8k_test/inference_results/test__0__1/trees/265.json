On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?\n\nSolution:\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of $350 000, which is (5/100)*$350 000 = $17 500.\nThe transfer fee is 12% of $350 000, which is (12/100)*$350 000 = $42 000.\nSo the total cost of the house, after all deductions are added, is $350 000 - $17 500 - $42 000 = $8 500\nTherefore, Mrs. Cruz will pay $8 500 more than her budget of $400 000 for the house.\n#### 8500\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.335782304406166, "len_probs": 181, "answer": "\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of $350 000, which is (5/100)*$350 000 = $17 500.\nThe transfer fee is 12% of $350 000, which is (12/100)*$350 000 = $42 000.\nSo the total cost of the house, after all deductions are added, is $350 000 - $17 500 - $42 000 = $8 500\nTherefore, Mrs. Cruz will pay $8 500 more than her budget of $400 000 for the house.\n#### 8500\n"}, {"text": "\nThe brokerage fee is $350 000 x 0.05 = $17 500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 0.12 = $42 000.\nSo the total cost of the buyer is $350 000 + $17 500 + $42 000 = $413 500.\nThus, Mrs. Cruz can spare only $400 000 - $413 500 = $13 500 more or less.\n#### 13500\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget.
