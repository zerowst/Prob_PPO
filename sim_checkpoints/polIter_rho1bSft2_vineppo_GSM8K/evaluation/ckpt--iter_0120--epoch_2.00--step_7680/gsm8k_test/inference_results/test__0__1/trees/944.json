is 10 x $2 = $20.\nAnd she can also earn from selling 4 carrots at $1.25 each, that is 4 x $1.25 = $5.\nSo the total amount she will earn is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.\nTherefore, Jen will be able to earn $34 after selling all of her crop.\nTherefore, she has earned $34.\n#### 34.\n#### <span class=\"cross\">&nbsp;</span>\n#### 34\n#### <span class=\"cross\">&nbsp;</span>\n#### 34\n</div>\n####
