collectively earn $2000*40 = $80,000 per month for their salaries.\nThe total number of employees is made up of junior and senior programmers, which is 40+2/5*total number of employees\nThis total number is also represented by the total of junior programmers' payroll, which is 40+2/5*total number of employees\nIf the monthly salary for senior programmers is $400 more than the monthly salary for junior programmers,\nIt means the total monthly salary for senior programmers is $2000+400 = $2400 per month.\nThe total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $2400*total number + $80,000\nWe found the total number was 2\nSo the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $2400*2+ $80,000\n#### 2400*2+80000\n#### 160000\n####
