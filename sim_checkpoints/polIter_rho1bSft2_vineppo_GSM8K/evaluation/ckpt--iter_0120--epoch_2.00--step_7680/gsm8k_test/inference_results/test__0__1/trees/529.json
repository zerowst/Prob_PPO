In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?\n\nSolution:\nThe cost of the CD was $4.\nThe cost of the total purchase was $48, so the amount not spent on CDs was $48 - $4 = $44.\nThe cost of the headphone set was an additional cost of $4.\nThe number of CDs that could be bought without the headphone set not spent would be $44 \u00f7 $4/CD = 11 CDs.\nThus, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he did not have to buy the headphone set.\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\"> <img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2402/5044535778_1440367433_b.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /> </a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartavelle/5044535778/\">", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -70.41427043452859, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe cost of the CD was $4.\nThe cost of the total purchase was $48, so the amount not spent on CDs was $48 -
