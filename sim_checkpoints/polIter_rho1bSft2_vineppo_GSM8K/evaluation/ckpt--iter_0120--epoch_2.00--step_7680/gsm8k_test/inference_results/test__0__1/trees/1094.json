Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how many total sodas are in the case after Ellen took 1 out: 12 - 1 (her friend took one) = 11\nThen figure out how many sodas Ellen's brother took: 3 (for himself)\nAnd how many of those he took were unshaken: 1\nSo the odds of Ellen's brother's soda being unshaken is 1/4.\nNow figure out how many total sodas Ellen's friend took. She took 2 of the 10 unshaken sodas left\nSo the odds of Ellen's friend getting soda from a shaken can is 10/11 * 1/4 = 25%\n#### 25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.39642459899187, "len_probs": 167, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how many total sodas are in the case after Ellen took 1 out: 12 - 1 (her friend took one) = 11\nThen figure out how many sodas Ellen's brother took: 3 (for himself)\nAnd how many of those he took were unshaken: 1\nSo the odds of Ellen's brother's soda being unshaken is 1/4.\nNow figure out how many total sodas Ellen's friend took.
