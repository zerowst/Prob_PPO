He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy. If Matthew would agree to that offer, how much money would he earn?\n\nSolution:\nMatthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy.\nHalf of Matthew's 12 toys, or 12 / 2 = 6 toys, he would sell for $5 each, and\nThe other half of his toys, or 6 toys, he would sell for $7 each.\nThe first option would earn him $5 x 6 = $30.\nThe second option would earn him $7 x 6 = $42.\nHence, the total amount Matthew would earn is $42 (if he sold the 6 for $7 each) or $42 (if he sold the 6 for $5 each).\nThe amount he earns is dependent on whether he has more $5 or $7 per $1\nSo, we do not have to do any calculations for this problem. We can just say Matthew would earn $42 in total.\n#### 42\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.21660005301237, "len_probs": 248, "answer": "\nMatthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.
