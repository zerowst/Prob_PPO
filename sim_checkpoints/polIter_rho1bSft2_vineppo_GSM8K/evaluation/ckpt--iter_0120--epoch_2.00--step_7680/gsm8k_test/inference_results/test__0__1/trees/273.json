How many stitches does each sleeve take?\n\nSolution:\nThe collar takes a tenth of 900 stitches, or 900/10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, or 2*90 = 180 stitches.\nSo far the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.\nThe remaining stitches are the body of the sweater, which adds 1800-270 = 1530 stitches.\nEach sleeve will take 1530/2 = 765 stitches.\n#### 765\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.286271549761295, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nThe collar takes a tenth of 900 stitches, or 900/10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, or 2*90 = 180 stitches.\nSo far the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.\nThe remaining stitches are the body of the sweater, which adds 1800-270 = 1530 stitches.\nEach sleeve will take 1530/2 = 765 stitches.\n#### 765\n"}, {"text": "\nThe collar takes a tenth of 900 stitches, or 900/10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, or 2*90 = 180 stitches.\nThe decorative rosette takes a total of 180 stitches that are not included in the 90-stitch collar or the 90-stitch sleeve.\nThe total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800-180-90-0 = 910 stitches.\nEach sleeve takes 910/2 = 455 stitches.\n#### 455\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTerri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette.
