Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, 10 people were infected, and each day after that each of those 10 people infected 6 more people, so the number of new infections each day was 10 * 6 = 60.\nSo over three days, there were 3 * 60 = 180 new infections.\nThus, the total number of people who were infected after three days was 10 + 60 (each day you add a new 10 because you're counting the first day's 60 new infections), so 10 + 60 = 70 people. (Note: This is the same as the total as the initial number of infected was not counted on the first day.)\n#### 70\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -67.20268810726702, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nOn the first day, 10 people were infected, and each day after that each of those 10 people infected 6 more people, so the number of new infections each day was 10 * 6 = 60.\nSo over three days, there were 3 * 60 = 180 new infections.\nThus, the total number of people who were infected after three days was 10 + 60 (each day you add a new 10 because you're counting the first day's 60 new infections), so 10 + 60 = 70 people.
