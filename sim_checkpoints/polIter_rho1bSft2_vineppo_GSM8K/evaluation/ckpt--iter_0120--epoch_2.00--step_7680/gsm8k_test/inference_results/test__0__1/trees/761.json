"answer": "\nIf there are 6 Pomeranian girls among the total of 3 puppy girls, this means there is a total of 6/1\nIf this represents only a third of the total number of puppy girls, the total number of puppy girls is 6/1*total number of puppies.\nIf we let x be the total number of puppies, we can write this as:6/1*total number of puppy puppies=6\nSimplifying the above, we get: 6x=6\nDividing both
