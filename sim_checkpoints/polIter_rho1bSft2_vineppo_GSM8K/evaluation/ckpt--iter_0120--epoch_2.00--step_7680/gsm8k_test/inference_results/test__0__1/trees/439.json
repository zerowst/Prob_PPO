Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?\n\nSolution:\nBernadette\u2019s drive takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s, so it\u2019s 4 * 5 = 20 minutes.\nThe total drive time is 4 + 20, so it\u2019s 24 minutes total.\nBernadette should leave at 40 minutes before the 24-minute drive to the theater, or at 4:00 + 40 minutes, or 4:40 P.M.\nWayne should leave at the usual time, 4:00 P.M.\nThe difference in arrival time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.\n#### 36\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.08696749061346, "len_probs": 151, "answer": "\nBernadette\u2019s drive takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s, so it\u2019s 4 * 5 = 20 minutes.\nThe total drive time is 4 + 20, so it\u2019s 24 minutes total.\nBernadette should leave at 40 minutes before the 24-minute drive to the theater, or at 4:00 + 40 minutes, or 4:40 P.M.\nWayne should leave at the usual time, 4:00 P.M.\nThe difference in arrival time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.\n#### 36\n"}, {"text": "\nIf it takes four times as long to drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment as from Wayne\u2019s hotel, it takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to drive from Bernadette\u2019s hotel.\nIn addition to the 4-minute drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel, Bernadette must also wait for her one-minute head start, and then the drive from Bernadette\u2019s hotel takes 16 + 4 + 1 = 21 minutes to drive to the theater.\nTherefore, Bernadette should leave 4 minutes (for the 5-minute head start) minus the 21-minute drive for Wayne\u2019s hotel, or 46 minutes early.\n#### 46\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film.
