If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?\n\nSolution:\nOn the beach, Grandma walks at a rate that we can call b. We know that b = 2 miles per hour, and that she walks for 40 minutes at that rate, or a total of 40/60 = 2/3 hours.\nSo the time it takes her to walk 3 miles on the beach, which is at a rate of b, is 2/3 * b, or (2/3) * 2 = 4 miles.\nOn the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach, or 2b. So it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, or 2/3 hours.\nSo it takes her total time of 40 + 20 = 60 minutes to walk 3 miles.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.24926599860191, "len_probs": 192, "answer": "\nOn the beach, Grandma walks at a rate that we can call b.
