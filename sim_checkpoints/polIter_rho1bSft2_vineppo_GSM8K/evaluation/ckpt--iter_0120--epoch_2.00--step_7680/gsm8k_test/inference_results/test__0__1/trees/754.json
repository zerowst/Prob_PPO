Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?\n\nSolution:\nShe trades 90% of her 30 small stickers = (90/100)*30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons.\nShe gets an average price of p per small sticker, q per large sticker\nSo the total amount she pays for the large stickers is 30q\nShe trades 50% of her 40 large stickers = (50/100)*40 = 20 large stickers for small buttons.\nShe gets an average price of r per large sticker, s per small sticker\nSo the total amount she pays for the small stickers is 20r\nThe total number of buttons she has is the sum of the small and large buttons she has after trading\nSo the answer is 27 small + 20 large x (total amount paid for small + total amount paid for large\n= 27 + 20(p+r)\n#### 47\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.06765493005514, "len_probs": 216, "answer": "\nShe trades 90% of her 30 small stickers = (90/100)*30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons.\nShe gets an average price of p per small sticker, q per large sticker\nSo the total amount she pays for the large stickers is 30q\nShe trades 50% of her 40 large stickers = (50/100)*40 = 20 large stickers for small buttons.\nShe gets an average price of r per large sticker, s per small sticker\nSo the total amount she pays for the small stickers is 20r\nThe total number of buttons she has is the sum of the small and large buttons she has after trading\nSo the answer is 27 small + 20 large x (total amount paid for small + total amount paid for large\n= 27 + 20(p+r)\n#### 47\n"}]}
