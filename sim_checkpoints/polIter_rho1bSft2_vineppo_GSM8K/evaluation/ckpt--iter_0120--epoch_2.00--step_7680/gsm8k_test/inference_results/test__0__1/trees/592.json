How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost on Amazon is $16 for the boots and $4 for shipping, so the total is $16 + $4 = $20.\nOn eBay, the pair of shoes costs $13, and shipping is $26 (since it's twice as much as the $13 Amazon charges for shipping).\nSo the total cost on eBay is $13 + $26 (the cost for the boots and shipping), so the total is $13 + $26 = $39.\nTherefore, the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $39 - $20 = $19.\n#### 19.\n#### <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/The-19-The-20-The-30-The-40-The-50-The-60-The-70-The-80-The-90-The-100-The-110-The-120-The-130-The-140-The-150-The-160-The-170-The-180-The-190-The-200-The-210-The-220-The-230-The-240-The-250-The-260-The-270-The-280-The-290-The-300-The-310-The-320-The-330-The-340-The-350-The-360-The-370-The-380-The-390-The-400-The-410-The-420-The-430-The-440-The-450-The-460-The-470-The-480-The-490-The-500-The-510-The-520-The-530-The-540-The-550-The-560-The-570-The-580-The-590-The-600-The-610-The-620-The-630-The-640-The-650-The-660-The-670-The-680-The-690-The-700-The-710-The-720-The-730-The-740-The-750-The-760-The-770-The-780-The-790-The-800-The-810-The-820-The-830-The-840-The-850-The-860-The-870-The-880-The-890-The-900-The-910-The-920-The-930-The-940-The-950-The-960-The-970-The-980-The-990-The-1000-The-1010-The-1020-The-1030-The-1040-The-1050-The-1060-The-1070-The-1080-The-1090-The-1100-The-1110-The-1120-The-1130-The-1140-The-1150-The-1160-The-1170-The-1180-The-1190-The-1200-The-1210-The-1220-The-1230-The-1240-The-1250-The-1260-The-1270-The-1280-The-1290-The-1300-The-1310-The-1320-The-1330-The-1340-The-1350-The-1360-The-1370-", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -27.134846180677414, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe total cost on Amazon is $16 for the boots and $4 for shipping, so the total is $16 + $4 = $20.\nOn eBay, the pair of shoes costs $13, and shipping is $26 (since it's twice as much as the $13 Amazon charges for shipping).\nSo the total cost on eBay is $13 + $26 (the cost for the boots and shipping), so the total is $13 + $26 = $39.\nTherefore, the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $39 -

On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost on Amazon is $16 for the boots and $4 for shipping, so the total is $16 + $4 = $20.\nOn eBay, the pair of shoes costs $13, but shipping costs twice as much at $4 x 2 = $8.\nTherefore the total cost on eBay for the boots and shipping is $13 + $8,\nSo the total cost is $21.\nThe difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $21 - $20 = $1.\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -64.94524304196239, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe total cost on Amazon is $16 for the boots and $4 for shipping, so the total is $16 + $4 = $20.\nOn eBay, the pair of shoes costs $13, but shipping costs twice as much at $4 x 2 = $8.\nTherefore the total cost on eBay for the boots and shipping is $13 + $8,\nSo the total cost is $21.\nThe difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $21 - $20 = $1.\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659_4506872576.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"/>\n</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69244748@N05/5384699659\">\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5384/5384699659"}]}
