If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the cost of the asphalt to find the net cost: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75\nThen subtract the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt from the cost of the repair to find Ron's net savings: $75 - $120 - $450 = -$145\n#### 145\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.253867223858833, "len_probs": 106, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the cost of the asphalt to find the net cost: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75\nThen subtract the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt from the cost of the repair to find Ron's net savings: $75 - $120 - $450 = -$145\n#### 145\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the total cost of fixing the pothole to find Ron's net savings: $450 - $120 = $330\nThen find the total cost of the asphalt: $25/bucket x 3 buckets = $75\nThen subtract the cost of the asphalt from that amount to find Ron's net savings: $75 - $25 (because he only paid $25 for each bucket) =\n$50\nSo, Ron saves $50.\n#### 50\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRon is fed up with the pothole in front of his house.
