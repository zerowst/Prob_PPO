Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\n\nSolution:\nThe first thing we need to do is figure out the probability that either the teacher doesn't come or the class doesn't get an extension.\nIf we assume that the normal teacher comes and the class doesn't get an extension, there's a 10% chance Marcus gets an extension (100% - 20%).\nIf we assume the whole class gets an extension, there's a 40% chance Marcus gets an extension (100% + 20%).\nSo the total probability for these two scenarios is 10% + 40% = 50%\nSo, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50% - because it's either that or he doesn't get an extension, not both.\nSo the answer to Marcus's question is 50%\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.029853250831366, "len_probs": 194, "answer": "\nThe first thing we need to do is figure out the probability that either the teacher doesn't come or the class doesn't get an extension.\nIf we assume that the normal teacher comes and the class doesn't get an extension, there's a 10% chance Marcus gets an extension (100% - 20%).\nIf we assume the whole class gets an extension, there's a 40% chance Marcus gets an extension (100% + 20%).\nSo the total probability for these two scenarios is 10% + 40% = 50%\nSo, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50% - because it's either that or he doesn't get an extension, not both.\nSo the answer to Marcus's question is 50%\n#### 50\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst figure out the chance Marcus gets an extension if the teacher has a 40% chance of giving one out.
