hours (if they were traveling in opposite directions) would be: 60 + 30 = 90 miles.\nBut after every hour, the trains would be moving towards each other, so they would close the distance between each other.\nSo after 3 hours, they would be closing in on each other, so they would be 90 - 6 (because they were traveling 60 miles per hour in opposite directions) =\nSo the answer is 30\n(because 90 - 6*(which is 3 in this case because they are closing in on each other\nSo the answer is 30.\n#### 30\n"}]}
