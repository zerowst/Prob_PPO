So, they are currently 64 signatures behind the goal, which is X - 100.\nWe can set up the equation like this:\n64 + (X - 100)\nTo solve for X, we need to first simplify the equation:\n64 + X - 100 = X - 36\nThe two sisters want to collect a total number of signatures, so we can set X - 36 equal to 0\nX - 36 = 0\nX = 36.\nThe sisters want to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal.\n#### 36\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.859315633773804, "len_probs": 214, "answer": "\nCarol has collected 20 signatures in her book and Jennifer has 44 signatures in her book.
