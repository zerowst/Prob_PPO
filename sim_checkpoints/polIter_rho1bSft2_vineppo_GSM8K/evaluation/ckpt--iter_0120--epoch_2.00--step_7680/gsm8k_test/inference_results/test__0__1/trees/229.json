Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nThe number of ready melons after two months is 120 x 0.3 = 36.\nThe number of melons Ashlyn took home after two months\nSo the total number of ready melons after Ashlyn\u2019s visit was 36\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready for harvest, 36 x (3/4)\nSo the total number of melons after 3/4 were ready was 36 x (3/4)\nThe number of melons she took home total\nSo the total number of unready melons after the two weeks was 36 x (3/4) \u2013 1\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready for harvest, 36 x (3/4)\nSo the total number of unready melons after the two weeks was 36 x (3/4) \u2013 7\nSo the answer to the question is 7.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.36209646612406, "len_probs": 213, "answer": "\nThe number of ready melons after two months is 120 x 0.3 = 36.\nThe number of melons Ashlyn took home after two months\nSo the total number of ready melons after Ashlyn\u2019s visit was 36\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready for harvest, 36 x (3/4)\nSo the total number of melons after 3/4 were ready was 36 x (3/4)\nThe number of melons she took home total\nSo the total number of unready melons after the two weeks was 36 x (3/4) \u2013 1\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready for harvest, 36 x (3/4)\nSo the total number of unready melons after the two weeks was 36 x (3/4) \u2013 7\nSo the answer to the question is 7.\n#### 7\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total number of watermelons ready for harvest at the start is 120 * 0.30 = 36.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 4 of them\nThese 4 melons were left to 3/4\nSo the number of melons that 3/4\nSo the number of melons that were ready after\nSo the number after that was 36 * (3/4)\nSo the answer is 27\n#### 27\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
