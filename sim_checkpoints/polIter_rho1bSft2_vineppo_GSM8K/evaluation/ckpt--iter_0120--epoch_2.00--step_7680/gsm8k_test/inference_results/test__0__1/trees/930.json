Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of toys in the bag of building blocks, the bin of stuffed animals, and the tower of stacking rings is 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings\nThose four items total 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.\nSophie bought an additional tube of bouncy balls bringing the total number to 62 toys.\nIf the total number of toys is 62, then Sophie has 5/6 of a tube of bouncy balls in the toy box.\nEach tube has 3 bouncy balls so 5/6*3=2 bouncy balls could be in the tube.\n#### 2\n<script>\n</script>\n#### 2\n</script>\n#### 2\n</script>\n####
