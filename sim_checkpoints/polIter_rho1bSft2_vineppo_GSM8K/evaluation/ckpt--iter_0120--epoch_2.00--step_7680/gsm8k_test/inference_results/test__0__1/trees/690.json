How many coins are they having ten years after they started their savings?\n\nSolution:\nRong is saving 20 coins in his piggy bank every month, and so he is saving a total of 20*12 = 240 coins after 1 year.\nNeil is saving 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong is saving per month. This means Neil is saving 2/5*20 = 8 more coins per month in his piggy bank than Rong.\nSo, every month, Neil is saving 20+8 = 28 coins in his piggy bank.\nAfter 1 year, this total amount becomes 28*12 = 336 coins.\nAfter ten years, from the first to the tenth year, there will be 240 (year 1) to 336 (year 10)\nThe total amount of Rong's savings after 10 years will be 240+\n(years 1 to 10)\n240+(10-1)*\n(years 1 to 10)\n240+90 = 330\nRong\n#### 330\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -43.688758147880435, "len_probs": 264, "answer": "\nRong is saving 20 coins in his piggy bank every month, and so he is saving a total of 20*12 = 240 coins after 1 year.\nNeil is saving 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong is saving per month.
