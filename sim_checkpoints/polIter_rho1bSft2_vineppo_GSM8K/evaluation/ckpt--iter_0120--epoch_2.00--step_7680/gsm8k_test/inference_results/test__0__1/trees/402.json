The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?\n\nSolution:\nEach batch of brownies needs 3 cups of flour, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, so he needs 3*4 = 12 cups of flour.\nEach batch of brownies also needs 1 cup of milk, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, so he needs 1*4 = 4 cups of milk.\nThe recipe calls for 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk. To find how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, you need to: 12 (flour needed) / 2 (flour per bag) - 4 (flour\navailable)\n= 6 bags of flour\nIf:\nThe recipe calls for 2-cup bags of milk and 2-cup bottles of milk.
