The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?\n\nSolution:\nThe second friend pressed 1/4 * 20 = 5 times more than Jerome's first friend\nSo he pressed 20 + 5 = 25 times.\nThe third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.\nSo the total is 25 + 6 (the 4th friend) + 7 (the third friend)\nThat means a total of\n4 friends\nSo the\ntime\nis 25 + 60 + 70 = 155\n#### 155\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.366167057305574, "len_probs": 125, "answer": "\nThe second friend pressed 1/4 * 20 = 5 times more than Jerome's first friend\nSo he pressed 20 + 5 = 25 times.\nThe third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.\nSo the total is 25 + 6 (the 4th friend) + 7 (the third friend)\nThat means a total of\n4 friends\nSo the\ntime\nis 25 + 60 + 70 = 155\n#### 155\n"}]}
