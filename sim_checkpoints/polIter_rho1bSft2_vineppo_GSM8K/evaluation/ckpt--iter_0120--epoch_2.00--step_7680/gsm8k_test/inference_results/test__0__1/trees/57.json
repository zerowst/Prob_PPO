The solution is based on the assumption that the weight of each box is equal to 15 pounds.\n#### 246\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?\n\nSolution:\nThe driver weighs 15 x 1 = 15 pounds.\nThe total weight of the empty truck is 3755 - 15 = 3740 pounds.\nThe maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 3740 / 15 = 246 boxes.\nThe answer is 246.\nThe bridge does not restrict the number of boxes. It only restricts the weight of the truck.\nSo, it is safe to load 246 boxes onto the truck.\nNote: The above solution is valid only for this particular problem. The problem does not provide any information about the weight of the boxes. The solution is based on the assumption that the weight of each box is equal to 15 pounds.\n#### 246\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.6176326200366, "len_probs": 192, "answer": "\nThe driver weighs 15 x 1 = 15 pounds.\nThe total weight of the empty truck is 3755 - 15 = 3740 pounds.\nThe maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 3740 / 15 = 246 boxes.\nThe answer is 246.\nThe bridge does not restrict the number of boxes.
