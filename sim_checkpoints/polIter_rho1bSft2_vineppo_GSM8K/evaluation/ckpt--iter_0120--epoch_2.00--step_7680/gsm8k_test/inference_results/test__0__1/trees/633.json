How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?\n\nSolution:\nWe can figure out how long it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob by using the formula distance = rate x time. We know that Bob is 75 miles ahead and he is driving 55 miles per hour, so we can say that Bob has to travel a distance of 75 miles to catch up with the distance that he has already traveled (since he\u2019s already driving faster). Now we can use the formula to figure out how long it will take him to get 75 miles at an average rate of 70 miles per hour:\n\n75 miles / (70 miles/hour) = x\nx = 1.07 hours\n#### 1.07\n</span>\nSo it will take Tom about 1 hour and 44 minutes to catch up with Bob.\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n</body>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n#### 1.07\n</span>\n```\n```\n#### 1.0", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -35.127079110592604, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nWe can figure out how long it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob by using the formula distance = rate x time.
