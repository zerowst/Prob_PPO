A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nA third of the jellyfish are large, so 4 (the jellyfish are either small or large).\nOf the large jellyfish, 4/5 were not transformed, so 4/5 * 4 = 16 jellyfish did not change color.\nAnd 1/3 of the jellyfish were small, so 4/3 * 16 = 64 jellyfish are not large, blue or green.\nWhen a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish were transformed from blue to green, leaving 60\nThere were 64 - 6 = 58 jellyfish that were not transformed into blue.\nThus 64 - 6 = 58 jellyfish perception is correct.\n#### 58\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.3921537771821, "len_probs": 175, "answer": "\nA third of the jellyfish are large, so 4 (the jellyfish are either small or large).\nOf the large jellyfish, 4/5 were not transformed, so 4/5 * 4 = 16 jellyfish did not change color.\nAnd 1/3 of the jellyfish were small, so 4/3 * 16 = 64 jellyfish are not large, blue or green.\nWhen a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish were transformed from blue to green, leaving 60\nThere were 64 - 6 = 58 jellyfish that were not transformed into blue.\nThus 64 - 6 = 58 jellyfish perception is correct.\n#### 58\n"}]}
