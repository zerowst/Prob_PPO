The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?\n\nSolution:\nThe sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour, so over a 10-hour period, it will move a total of 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.\nHowever, this angle is not directly from the pyramid's base, but rather at the base of the pyramid's top face. To find the angle between the base of the pyramid and the sun, we can subtract the angle the sun makes with the ground from 90 degrees (the angle between the ground and a vertical line).\nThe angle between the ground and the sun is 32 degrees, so the angle between the base of the pyramid and the sun is 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.\nTherefore, when the sun has moved 50 degrees from the pyramid's top face, it will be at 90 + 50 = 140 degrees from the ground.\n#### 140\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.57155318558216, "len_probs": 212, "answer": "\nThe sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour, so over a 10-hour period, it will move a total of 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.\nHowever, this angle is not directly from the pyramid's base, but rather at the base of the pyramid's top face.
