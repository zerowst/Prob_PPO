other similar scenarios.\nIt is important to note that the solution above is not unique and can be used for other similar problems.\nAnother way to solve this problem is by using the formula for finding the total number of students in a school:\nTotal students = (Total number of boys / percentage of boys in the school) *\nTotal percentage of the school population that is made up of students\nTotal students = (240 / 0.4) * 100%\nTotal students = 600 students\nThe number of girls in the school is the total number of students \u2013 the number of boys = 600 students \u2013 240 boys = 360 girls.\nThus, there are a total of 360 girls in the school; the answer to the question.\n#### 360\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -56.18083160743117, "len_probs":
