Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?\n\nSolution:\nLet s be the number of small stuffed animals sold and l be the number of large stuffed animals. We know that l = 2s and the total amount of money from selling all the stuffed animals is 4l + 120.\nWe also know that l = 2s and thus substitute this into the other equation to get 4(2s) + 120 = $120\nThis simplifies to 8s + 120 = $120\nSubtracting 120 from each side gives 8s = $120 - $120 = $0\nDividing both sides by 8 gives s = $0 / 8 = $0.\nTherefore, she sold all of her 2s * $4 / 4 (because she was selling them in sets of 4)\nThis total amount is 0\nSo the answer to this is that there were no small stuffed animals sold (0).\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.70772461220622, "len_probs": 222, "answer": "\nLet s be the number of small stuffed animals sold and l be the number of large stuffed animals.
