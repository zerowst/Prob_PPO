For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?\n\nSolution:\nTim needs 6 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice, so he needs 6 x 4 = 24 cups of lemon juice\nTim's recipe makes a gallon of lemonade with 24 cups of lemon juice, so he needs to make 1/2 a gallon\nThis means he must make 4 + 1 extra gallon x (total 5 gallons)\nThis 5 gallons has 24 cups per gallon * 2 cups extra per gallon\nSo Tim needs 24 x 5 = 120 lemons.\n#### 120\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.232994955033064, "len_probs": 147, "answer": "\nTim needs 6 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice, so he needs 6 x 4 = 24 cups of lemon juice\nTim's recipe makes a gallon of lemonade with 24 cups of lemon juice, so he needs to make 1/2 a gallon\nThis means he must make 4 + 1 extra gallon x (total 5 gallons)\nThis 5 gallons has 24 cups per gallon * 2 cups extra per gallon\nSo Tim needs 24 x 5 = 120 lemons.\n#### 120\n"}, {"text": "\nTim needs 1 cup of juice per gallon of lemonade and he wants to make 4+1=5 gallons of lemonade for the party\nEach gallon has 1/6 cup of juice\nHe needs 6 lemons per cup of juice\nSo he needs 6*1/6=6 lemons per gallon of lemonade\nHe wants to make 5 gallons of lemonade so he needs 5*6=30 lemons.\nBut, Allen wants twice as much tart as the other gallons, so the extra gallon will be twice as much\nSo, Tim needs 6*1/6*2=12 lemons for the extra gallon of lemonade\nSo, Tim needs 30+12=42 lemons.\n#### 42\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.
