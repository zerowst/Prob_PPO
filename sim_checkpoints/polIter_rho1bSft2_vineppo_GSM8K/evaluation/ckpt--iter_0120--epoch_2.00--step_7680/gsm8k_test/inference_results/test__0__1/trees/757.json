Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium.  Six more students need size extra-large than large.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?\n\nSolution:\nExtra-small = 11\nSmall = 2(extra-small)=2(11)=22\nMedium = 2(size)\nso 2(size)=22\nSo size = 11\nLarge = (size)=11\nextra-large = 4 less than size 11\nSo extra-large = 11-4=7\nSo the total is 11+22+11+7+6 = 59\n#### 59\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.057608142495155, "len_probs": 115, "answer": "\nExtra-small = 11\nSmall = 2(extra-small)=2(11)=22\nMedium = 2(size)\nso 2(size)=22\nSo size = 11\nLarge = (size)=11\nextra-large = 4 less than size 11\nSo extra-large = 11-4=7\nSo the total is 11+22+11+7+6 = 59\n#### 59\n"}, {"text": "\nExtra-small shirts:11*2=22\nSize Small:22*2=44\nSize Medium:44-4=40\nSize Large:40/2=20\nSize Extra Large:20+6=26\nIn total, 11+11\nKrissa ordered,\nShe ordered 22,44,20,20,40 extra smalls, smalls, mediums, large, and extra large\nShe ordered 22+44+20+20+40+26\nShe ordered 132\n#### 132\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKrissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 11 students need size extra-small.
