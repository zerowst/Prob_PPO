The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has room for 12 + 7 = 19 rooms.\nSo, the entire space station could contain a total of 72 / 19 = 4 cylindrical structures.\nThus, the entire space station contains 4 * 3 = 12 bedrooms,\nAnd 4 * 2 (since there are 2 tunnels per cylinder)\n= 8 kitchens,\nOr 12 * 3 kitchens\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.645539581775665, "len_probs": 115, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has room for 12 + 7 = 19 rooms.\nSo, the entire space station could contain a total of 72 / 19 = 4 cylindrical structures.\nThus, the entire space station contains 4 * 3 = 12 bedrooms,\nAnd 4 * 2 (since there are 2 tunnels per cylinder)\n= 8 kitchens,\nOr 12 * 3 kitchens\n#### 12\n"}, {"text": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and some kitchens.\nEach bedroom is typically shared by two people, so each bedroom represents a total of 2*bedrooms\nEach bathroom is typically shared by three people, so each bathroom represents a total of 3*bathrooms\nThe total number of rooms in each cylindrical structure is then (12*bedrooms)+(7*bathrooms)\nSo the total number of rooms in each cylindrical structure is (12*2)+(7*3)=\nThere are 24+21=45 rooms in each cylindrical structure.\nThe entire space station has 72 rooms, so there are on the entire station 4 spaces left\nThose 4 spaces are 45 rooms each, so totaling 4*45=180 rooms in the entire station.\nTherefore, there are on the entire station 72-42=30 kitchens\n#### 30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.
