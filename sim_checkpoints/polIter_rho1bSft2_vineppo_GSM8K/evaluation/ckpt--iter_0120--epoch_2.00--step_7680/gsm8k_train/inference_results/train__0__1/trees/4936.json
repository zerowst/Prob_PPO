If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?\n\nSolution:\nOn the second day, Kim brings 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of earrings.\nOn the third day, Kim brings 6 - 1 = 5 pairs of earrings.\nIn total there are 3 + 6 + 5 = 14 pairs of earrings.\nTherefore:\nShe needs to trade them for 14 / 9 = 1 and a half days.\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n#### 1\n#### <a href=\"https://www.kristenbrown.com/\">Kristen Brown</a>\n####", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -7.917144443839788, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nOn the second day, Kim brings 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of earrings.\nOn the third day, Kim brings 6 -
