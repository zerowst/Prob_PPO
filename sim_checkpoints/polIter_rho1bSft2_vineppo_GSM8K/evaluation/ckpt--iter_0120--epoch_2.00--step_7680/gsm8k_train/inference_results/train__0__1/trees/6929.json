This is done by subtracting the cost of making each book ($5) from the $20 profit per book ($20 - $5 = $15 profit per book sold).\nNext, we divide the total profit by the profit per book to determine the number of books needed to achieve the desired profit. $120 / $15 per book = 8 books.\nNow, we need to determine how many people in total made the books. We do this by dividing the total number of books (8) by the number of books each customer buys (2). 8 books / 2 books per customer = 4 customers\n#### 4\n"}, {"text": "\nShe makes a profit of $120 on each book sold\nSo the total income from selling all books\n$20 x (number of books sold)\n= $120\nSo number of books sold: $120 / $20 (profit per book) = 6 books.\nEach book costs $5 to make\nSo, total profit from 6 books = 6 books x ($5 cost per book profit\n= $30\nShe makes a total profit of $120\nSo, the number of books she sold at $5 cost per book\n= 6 books total profit\n= profit from each book\n= 6\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTina is getting $20 for each book she sells.
