How many feet did Rich walk?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, Rich walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.\nThen he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road. This makes his total distance so far 200 feet.\nNext, Rich walks double his total distance so far, which is 2*200 = 400 feet.\nThis makes his total distance 400 + his initial 20 feet gives 400+20 = 420 feet.\nThen, Rich walks half the total distance up to this point again, which is 1/2*420 = 210 feet.\nThis makes his total distance 210 + his initial 20 feet gives 210+20 = 230 feet.\nFinally, Rich walks his total distance back home, which is 230 feet.\nTherefore, the total distance Rich walked is 420+230 = 650 feet.\n#### 650\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.978167831897736, "len_probs": 231, "answer": "\nFirst, Rich walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.\nThen he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.
