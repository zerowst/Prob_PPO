There are 60 questions on the test. 30 are multiple-choice and 30 are fill-in-the-blank. It takes her 15 minutes to learn each multiple-choice question and 25 minutes each to learn the fill-in-the-blank questions. How many hours will she need to study before she is ready for the test?\n\nSolution:\nShe has to learn 30 x 15 minutes = 450 minutes for the multiple-choice questions.\nShe has to learn 30 x 25 = 750 for the fill-in-the-blank questions.\nSo, she has to learn a total of 450 + 750 = 1200.\nEach hour she has to spend 60 / 5 (because 30 is the number of multiple-choice questions and she has to learn them all, so it's a common multiple of all the questions),\nSo she has to study for 1200 / 5 = 24 hours to study.\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.41918120533228, "len_probs": 156, "answer": "\nShe has to learn 30 x 15 minutes = 450 minutes for the multiple-choice questions.\nShe has to learn 30 x 25 = 750 for the fill-in-the-blank questions.\nSo, she has to learn a total of 450 + 750 = 1200.\nEach hour she has to spend 60 / 5 (because 30 is the number of multiple-choice questions and she has to learn them all, so it's a common multiple of all the questions),\nSo she has to study for 1200 / 5 = 24 hours to study.\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nShe has to learn 30 x 2 for the fill-in-the-blank questions because she has to learn 30\nShe has to learn 15\nShe has to learn the multiple-choice questions in a total of 10\nShe will need to learn the 30 total because 3\nShe will need to learn this because 1\nShe will need to learn this\nShe needs to learn this\nShe will need to study 1\nShe will need to study 450minutes in total\nShe will need to study this many hours because 450 / 60 = 7\n#### 7\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMartiza is studying for the citizenship test.
