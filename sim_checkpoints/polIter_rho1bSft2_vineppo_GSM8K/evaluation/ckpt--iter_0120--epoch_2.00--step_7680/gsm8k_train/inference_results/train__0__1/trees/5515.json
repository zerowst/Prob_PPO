She buys food for both of the animals for $30 in total a week. Julia has the rabbit for 5 weeks, and the parrot for 3 weeks. How much money did Julia already spend on food for her animals, if the weekly cost of the rabbit food is $12?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount of money the rabbit needs per week is $12 * 5 = $60.\nJulia spends this amount on food for her parrot, which she has for 3 weeks. So the total amount of money she is spending for the parrot food is $60 * 3 = $180.\nThe weekly cost of the parrot food is $30 - $12 (the rabbit food cost for the same amount is $18, subtract the rabbit food cost from the total cost for the other parrot's food.)\nSo, the weekly cost for the parrot is $30 - $12 = $18.\nTherefore, the total amount she is spending per week on the parrot food is $18 x 3 = $54.\nSo, Julia spent $54 * total parrot food weeks\n$54 * total weeks\n= $54 * (3 + total parrot food weeks\nJulia has already spend $180 + $54\n$234 on her parrot food.\n#### 234\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -64.76569283381104, "len_probs": 248, "answer": "\nThe total amount of money the rabbit needs per week is $12 * 5 = $60.\nJulia spends this amount on food for her parrot, which she has for 3 weeks.
