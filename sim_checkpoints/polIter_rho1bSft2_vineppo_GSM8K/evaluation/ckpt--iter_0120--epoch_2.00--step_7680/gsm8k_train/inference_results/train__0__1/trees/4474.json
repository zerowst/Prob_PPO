How many months does Gerald spend in jail?\n\nSolution:\nThe total sentence length is 3 months + 2 years = 3 + 2\nSince he was three times in the books, the increase is 3*(1/3)=1\nSo his sentence was extended by 1 month per three\nSo he spends 3+2+(1/3)=3.33 months\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.57267913222313, "len_probs": 77, "answer": "\nThe total sentence length is 3 months + 2 years = 3 + 2\nSince he was three times in the books, the increase is 3*(1/3)=1\nSo his sentence was extended by 1 month per three\nSo he spends 3+2+(1/3)=3.33 months\n#### 3\n"}]}
