The amount of time she spent building it is equal to three times the amount of time she spent planning it minus 5 minutes. If she spent 67 minutes on the diorama total, how many minutes did she spend building it?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the amount of time she spent planning the diorama.\nThe amount of time she spent building it is three times that amount, or 3x.\nThe total amount of time spent on the diorama is the amount of time she spent planning it plus the amount of time she spent building it minus 5, or\nx + 3x - 5.\nThe total amount of time she spent on the diorama is the total time is the sum of x and 67, so\n4x - 5 = 67.\nAdd 5 to both sides of the equation to get 4x = 72.\nDivide both sides by 4 to get x = 18.\nSo the amount of time she spent building it is three times that amount, or 3(18) =\n#### 18.\n#### 67\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">Annie's diorama</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitahistory.com/\">here</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.anitah", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -28.27343326807022, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nLet x be the amount of time she spent planning the diorama.\nThe amount of time she spent building it is three times that amount, or 3x.\nThe total amount of time spent on the diorama is the amount of time she spent planning it plus the amount of time she spent building it minus 5, or\nx + 3x -
