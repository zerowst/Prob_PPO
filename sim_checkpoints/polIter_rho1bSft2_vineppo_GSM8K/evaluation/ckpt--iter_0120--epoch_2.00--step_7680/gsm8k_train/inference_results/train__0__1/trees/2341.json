The amount of $65 is the difference.\nAnother way to find the difference in amounts is to find the difference in their sum.\nAnother way to find the difference is to find how much\nThe difference between the two amounts is $65\n#### 65\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -55.632712334394455, "len_probs": 170, "answer": "\nThe total cost of ice cream is 15 * $5 = $75.\nThe total cost of pudding is 5 * $2 = $10.\nThus, Jane spent 75 \u2013 10 = $65 more on ice cream than on pudding.
