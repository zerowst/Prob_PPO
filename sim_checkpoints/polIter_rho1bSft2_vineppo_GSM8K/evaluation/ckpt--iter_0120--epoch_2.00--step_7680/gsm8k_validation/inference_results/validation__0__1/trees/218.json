3 bolts\nHe used that 7 - 6 bolts = 1 bolts\nHe used that 7 - 6 nuts\nSo the total is he used 1 * 3 = 3 bolts\nAnd he used 1 * 6 = 6 nuts.\n#### 1\n#### 3\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-1\">1</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-2\">3</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-3\">6</a>\n</span>\n#### 3\n#### 6\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-1\">1</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-2\">3</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-3\">6</a>\n</span>\n#### 1\n#### 6\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-1\">1</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-2\">3</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-3\">6</a>\n</span>\n#### 3\n#### 6\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap-calculus-basics-chapters/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10/ap-calculus-basics-chapters-10-problem-1\">1</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-basics/ap", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -34.802297089248896, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe builder purchased 7 boxes * 11 bolts/box = 77 bolts.\nThe builder purchased 3 boxes * 15 nuts/box = 45 nuts.\nHe had 3 bolts = 3\nHe had 6 nuts = 6\nSo the total number of bolts and nuts is 77 +\nHe used this to calculate: 7\nHe used that 7 -
