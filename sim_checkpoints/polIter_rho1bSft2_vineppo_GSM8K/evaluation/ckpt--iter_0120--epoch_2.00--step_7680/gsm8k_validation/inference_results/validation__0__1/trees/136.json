The number of these was:\n48 - (17 + 10) = 1\nSo he sold those at $22 each for total of _\n1*22 = $22.\nThe total profit then would be if we subtract the total sales from the total cost:\n$576 - $22 = $554\n$22 *\nSo the salesman had a profit of $22.\n#### 22\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.515154846012592, "len_probs": 186, "answer": "\nThe salesman sold 17 backpacks at $18 for a total of 17*18 = $306.\nHe also sold 10 backpacks for $25 each, so he made 10*25 = $250.\nThere were other sales as well, because the total number of backpacks sold was 48.
