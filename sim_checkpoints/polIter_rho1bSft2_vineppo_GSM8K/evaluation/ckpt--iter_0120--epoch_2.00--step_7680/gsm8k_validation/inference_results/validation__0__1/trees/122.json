Matt goes up the stairs 20 steps per minute. Tom goes up the stairs 5 steps per minute more than Matt. If Matt has reached 220 steps above the entrance, how many steps will Tom have gone up by that time?\n\nSolution:\nTom goes up the stairs at 5 steps/min + 20 steps/min = 25 steps/min.\nSo, he goes up 20\nThat means in 1 minute he goes up 20 * (1st to 2nd floor)\nIn x minutes, he goes up 20 * (1st to 2nd floor)\nHe's gone up a total of 220 + (x)\nSo, Tom has gone up 220 + (x) * 25\nWe are told he has reached 220 + (x)\nTherefore (x) * 25 = 220\nSo, x = 8\nTherefore total is 220 + 8 = 228 steps.\n#### 228\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.1079551205039, "len_probs": 181, "answer": "\nTom goes up the stairs at 5 steps/min + 20 steps/min = 25 steps/min.\nSo, he goes up 20\nThat means in 1 minute he goes up 20 * (1st to 2nd floor)\nIn x minutes, he goes up 20 * (1st to 2nd floor)\nHe's gone up a total of 220 + (x)\nSo, Tom has gone up 220 + (x) * 25\nWe are told he has reached 220 + (x)\nTherefore (x) * 25 = 220\nSo, x = 8\nTherefore total is 220 + 8 = 228 steps.\n#### 228\n"}, {"text": "\nTom goes up the stairs at a rate of 20 + 5 = 25 steps per minute.\nThere are 220 / 20 (minute rate for Matt) = 11 of those\nSo, Matt has been walking for 11 * (min);\nThe time that is left is 4 more\nSo, Tom goes up at a rate of\n(25 steps/min) * (4 more/time);\nSo, Tom goes up 25 * (4 more/time) =\n[25 * (4 more/time)] * (min) =\n[25 * 4]\n= 100 steps per minute.\nSo, Tom goes up 220 / 2 (min) *\n(100 steps/min) =\n1100 steps by that time.\n#### 1100\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMatt and Tom both walk up the stairs of the library.
