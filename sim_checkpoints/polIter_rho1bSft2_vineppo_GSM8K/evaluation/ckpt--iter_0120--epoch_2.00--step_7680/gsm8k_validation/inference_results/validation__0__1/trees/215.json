In addition, Elmer has a son named Melvin, who loves to catch pollywogs, remove them from the pond, and release them into a nearby stream.  For the first 20 days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream.  How many days did it take for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond?\n\nSolution:\nThe pond initially contained 2400 pollywogs.\n50 pollywogs left the pond each day, for a total of 2400 - 50 per day\n12\ndays\nsince the total number of pollywogs was initially less than the rate at which they were leaving the pond.\nAfter 20 of those days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream.\nFor the first 2\n[\n] days, Melvin caught and released 10\nper day\nso he captured and released 10 x 2 = 20 pollywogs.\nThe pond initially contained 2400 - 20\n= 2380 pollywogs.\nTherefore all of the pond\u2019s pollywogs disappeared over time\n2380 - 20\n= 2360 days.\n#### 2360\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.85472946241498, "len_probs": 218, "answer": "\nThe pond initially contained 2400 pollywogs.\n50 pollywogs left the pond each day, for a total of 2400 - 50 per day\n12\ndays\nsince the total number of pollywogs was initially less than the rate at which they were leaving the pond.\nAfter 20 of those days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream.\nFor the first 2\n[\n] days, Melvin caught and released 10\nper day\nso he captured and released 10 x 2 = 20 pollywogs.\nThe pond initially contained 2400 - 20\n= 2380 pollywogs.\nTherefore all of the pond\u2019s pollywogs disappeared over time\n2380 - 20\n= 2360 days.\n#### 2360\n"}]}
