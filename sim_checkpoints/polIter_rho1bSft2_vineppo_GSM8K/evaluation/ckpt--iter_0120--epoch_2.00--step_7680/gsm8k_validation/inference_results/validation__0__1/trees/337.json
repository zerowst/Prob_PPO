Carson has to mow 40 lines to cover the whole yard, and it takes him 2 minutes to mow one line. He also needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, each with 7 flowers, and it takes him half a minute to plant each flower. How many minutes will Carson spend gardening?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how long it takes Carson to mow the lawn: 40 lines * 2 minutes/line = 80 minutes.\nThen figure out how many flowers are in each row: 7 flowers\nThen figure out how long it takes him to plant each one: 1/2 minute\nSo he has 8*(7 flowers)/(each)= 56 total flowers to plant\nSo it will take Carson 56 * half a minute/flower = 28\nSo in total Carson will work: 80 minutes + 28 minutes = 108 minutes.\n#### 108\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.89681376516819, "len_probs": 141, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how long it takes Carson to mow the lawn: 40 lines * 2 minutes/line = 80 minutes.\nThen figure out how many flowers are in each row: 7 flowers\nThen figure out how long it takes him to plant each one: 1/2 minute\nSo he has 8*(7 flowers)/(each)= 56 total flowers to plant\nSo it will take Carson 56 * half a minute/flower = 28\nSo in total Carson will work: 80 minutes + 28 minutes = 108 minutes.\n#### 108\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst figure out how long it takes Carson to mow the lawn: 40 lines * 2 minutes/line = 80 minutes.\nThen figure out how long it takes Carson to plant flowers: (8 rows * 7 flowers/row) * 0.5\n= 8 * 40,\n= 320 minutes.\nNow add the two times together to find how long he spends: 320\n+ 80\n= 400.\n#### 400\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCarson needs to mow the lawn and plant some flowers.
