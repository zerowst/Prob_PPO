A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe total number of dinosaur models bought was 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe original total cost for the 6 dinosaur models is $100 x 2 = $200.\nTherefore, the 5% discount means you pay $200 x 0.05 = $10 less.\nSo the reduced price for each dinosaur model is $200 - $10 = $190.\nTherefore total cost for all 6 dinosaur models is $190 x 6 = $1140.\n#### 1140\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.480127647519112, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe total number of dinosaur models bought was 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe original total cost for the 6 dinosaur models is $100 x 2 = $200.\nTherefore, the 5% discount means you pay $200 x 0.05 = $10 less.\nSo the reduced price for each dinosaur model is $200 - $10 = $190.\nTherefore total cost for all 6 dinosaur models is $190 x 6 = $1140.\n#### 1140\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models.\nThe school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 models for the kindergarten and elementary libraries.\nEach model cost $100, so the total cost for these models is 2\nThe school also bought these 6 models at a 5% discount: $100 x 0.05 = $5\nSo each model cost $100 - $5 = $95.\nTherefore the total cost for all the models was $95 x 6 = $570.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
