How many carrots were not used that day?\n\nSolution:\nBefore lunch, the cook used 2/5 * 300 = 120 carrots.\nThis means there were 300 - 120 = 180 carrots remaining.\nAt the end of the day, he used 3/5 * 180 = 108 carrots.\nThis means there were 180 - 108 = 72 carrots not used that day.\nTherefore the answer is 72. (You didn't have to do any calculations as I did that for you.)\nThe other way to do it is:\nThe cook had a total of 3 things to do:\n1. Use 1/5 of what was left\n2. Use 3/5 of what was remaining\nAfter doing that, he did not have enough to do the 3rd thing\nThat means he did not do it correctly because that would mean he did it in a way that was not enough\nTherefore the answer is 72\nThere are no other carrots to do the other 3 things\nThat means he did them both correctly\nThat means he did not have enough to do the last thing\n#### 72\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -71.85701873898506, "len_probs": 269, "answer": "\nBefore lunch, the cook used 2/5 * 300 = 120 carrots.\nThis means there were 300 - 120 = 180 carrots remaining.\nAt the end of the day, he used 3/5 * 180 = 108 carrots.\nThis means there were 180 - 108 = 72 carrots not used that day.\nTherefore the answer is 72.
