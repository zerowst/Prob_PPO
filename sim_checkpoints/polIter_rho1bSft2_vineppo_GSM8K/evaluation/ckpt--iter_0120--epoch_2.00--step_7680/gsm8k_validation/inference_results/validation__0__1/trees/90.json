Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\n\nSolution:\nJulia bakes 5 - 1 = 4 cakes per day (since she's one less than 5)\nOver 6 days, she bakes 4 * 6 = 24 cakes.\nHowever, every other day, Clifford eats one of Julia's cakes. Since Clifford is unpredictable, he might eat a cake on any given day, but most days he'll eat a cake on an odd-numbered day.\nThere are 6 days total, so Clifford eats 3 cakes over 6 days.\nThat means Clifford eats one less than 5 / 2 = 2 cakes per 2 days (every other day)\nSo, Clifford eats 2 - 1 = 1 less cake per day than Julia\nOver 6 days, Clifford eats 1 * 3 = 3 cakes less than Julia\nIn the 6 days, Julia baked 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes left\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.65655693039298, "len_probs": 241, "answer": "\nJulia bakes 5 - 1 = 4 cakes per day (since she's one less than 5)\nOver 6 days, she bakes 4 * 6 = 24 cakes.\nHowever, every other day, Clifford eats one of Julia's cakes.
