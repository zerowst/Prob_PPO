She bought 600 minnows, and each prize is a bowl with 3 minnows. If 800 people are going to play the game and 15% win a prize, how many minnows will be left over?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how many prizes are going to be given out by multiplying the total number of people by the number of prizes per person: 800 people * 3 prizes/person = 2400 prizes.\nThen figure out how many prizes are going to be given out that are worth enough to win by multiplying the total number of prizes by the percentage of win: 2400 prizes * 15% = 360 prizes.\nNow figure out how many minnows in total are being given out by multiplying the number of prizes by the number of minnows per prize: 3 prizes/each * 2400 prizes = 72,000 minnows.\nNow figure out how many minnows are left over by subtracting the number of minnows given away from the total: 600 minnows / 3 minnows/each = 200 minnows left.\nFinally, subtract the number of minnows that were given away from the total to find the number of leftover minnows: 200 minnows - 4 minnows (since 1\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -31.582107663154602, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how many prizes are going to be given out by multiplying the total number of people by the number of prizes per person: 800 people * 3 prizes/person = 2400 prizes.\nThen figure out how many prizes are going to be given out that are worth enough to win by multiplying the total number of prizes by the percentage of win: 2400 prizes * 15% = 360 prizes.\nNow figure out how many minnows in total are being given out by multiplying the number of prizes by the number of minnows per prize: 3 prizes/each * 2400 prizes = 72,000 minnows.\nNow figure out how many minnows are left over by subtracting the number of minnows given away from the total: 600 minnows / 3 minnows/each = 200 minnows left.\nFinally, subtract the number of minnows that were given away from the total to find the number of leftover minnows: 200 minnows -
