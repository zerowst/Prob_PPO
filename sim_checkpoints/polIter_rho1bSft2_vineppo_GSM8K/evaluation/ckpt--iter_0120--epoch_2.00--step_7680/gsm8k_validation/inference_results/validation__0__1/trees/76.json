There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?\n\nSolution:\nThe new school needs an additional 1590 x 0.4 = 636 students.\nThere will be one 20-person advanced class, so we divide 636 / 2 = 318 students.\nThe rest of the students will be divided into 6 classes each. So we get 636 - ( 1 initial class for 20 students +\nanother 2 for\n318\n)\nSo each normal class will get\n[636 - (20*3)] / 6 = 10 students.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.65811339765787, "len_probs": 134, "answer": "\nThe new school needs an additional 1590 x 0.4 = 636 students.\nThere will be one 20-person advanced class, so we divide 636 / 2 = 318 students.\nThe rest of the students will be divided into 6 classes each.
