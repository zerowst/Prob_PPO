One employee works for $20 an hour. The other employee works for $22 an hour, but Casey would also get a $6/hour subsidy from the government for hiring a disabled worker. How much money per week would Casey save by hiring the cheaper employee, if they both work 40 hours per week?\n\nSolution:\nThe cheaper employee works for $20 an hour, so for 40 hours, their hourly cost is 20 * 40 = $800.\nThey also get a $6/hour subsidy for being disabled, so the subsidy amount is 6/40 * $800 (since there's only one type of disability subsidy),\nwhich equals $24. So, the cheaper employee's total cost is $800 - $24 = $776 per week.\nTherefore, Casey saves $776 / 7 (hours) = $12 per hour by hiring the cheaper employee.\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.33391559496522, "len_probs": 159, "answer": "\nThe cheaper employee works for $20 an hour, so for 40 hours, their hourly cost is 20 * 40 = $800.\nThey also get a $6/hour subsidy for being disabled, so the subsidy amount is 6/40 * $800 (since there's only one type of disability subsidy),\nwhich equals $24.
