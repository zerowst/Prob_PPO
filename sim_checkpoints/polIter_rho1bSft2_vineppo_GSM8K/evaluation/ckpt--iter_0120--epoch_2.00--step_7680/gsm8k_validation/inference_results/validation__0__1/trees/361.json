He wants to buy 5 kilograms of apples, 3 packs of sugar, and 500 grams of walnuts. One kilogram of apples costs $2, and one kilogram of walnuts costs $6. One pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than one kilogram of apples. How much Fabian needs to pay for the items he wants to buy?\n\nSolution:\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost $1 less per kilogram than one-kilogram apples, so each cost $2 - $1 = $1 per kilogram.\nSo three packs of sugar cost $1 x 3 = $3.\n500 grams of walnuts cost $6.\nSince one pack of sugar is $1 less per kilogram than one-kilogram apples,\nSo the 3 packs of sugar cost $1 x 3 = $3 less than $10.\nTherefore, Fabian needs to pay $10 + $3 + $6 + ( $3 \u2212 $1)\nTherefore, he needs to pay $10 + $3 + $6 + $4 = $23.\n#### 23\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.646802745759487, "len_probs": 190, "answer": "\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost $1 less per kilogram than one-kilogram apples, so each cost $2 - $1 = $1 per kilogram.\nSo three packs of sugar cost $1 x 3 = $3.\n500 grams of walnuts cost $6.\nSince one pack of sugar is $1 less per kilogram than one-kilogram apples,\nSo the 3 packs of sugar cost $1 x 3 = $3 less than $10.\nTherefore, Fabian needs to pay $10 + $3 + $6 + ( $3 \u2212 $1)\nTherefore, he needs to pay $10 + $3 + $6 + $4 = $23.\n#### 23\n"}, {"text": "\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost $1 less per kilogram than one dollar, so each pack costs $2.\nSo Fabian pays $10\n500 grams of walnuts is equal to 5 x less than $6/kilogram, so it's $6 - $3 = $3\nSo the total cost for the apples, sugar, and walnuts is: $10 + $3 + $5\nHence, Fabian pays $18 in total for the items he wants to buy.\n#### 18\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nFabian is shopping at a nearby supermarket.
