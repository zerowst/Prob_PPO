The overskirt is a rectangle that measures 12 feet by 4 feet, so its area is 12 * 4 = 48 square feet.\nShe also needs to calculate how much material she will use for each of her petticoats. Each petticoat is a rectangle that measures 12 feet by 4 feet, so its area is 12 * 4 = 48 square feet.\nNext, Jenna needs to calculate how much material she will use for the sleeves of her costume. Each sleeve is a square that measures 2 feet by 5 feet, so each sleeve\u2019s area is 2 * 5 = 10 square feet.\nShe will need 2 sleeves, so she will use 2 * 10 = 20 square feet of material in total for the sleeves.\nNow, Jenna can add all her measurements together to calculate how much material she needs in total: 48 + 48 (for skirt) + 20 (for sleeves) = 116 square feet of material.\nFinally, Jenna can multiply this total by the cost per square foot to find out how much she will spend: $116 * $3 per square foot = $348.\n#### 348\n"}, {"text": "\nEach skirt takes a rectangle of 12 feet by 4 feet, so it measures 48 square feet.\nSo each skirt costs 48 / 2 = 24\nThe overskirt takes 4 of the skirts, so it\u2019s 4 x 24 = 96.\nEach petticoat takes 12 feet by 4 feet, so it measures 48 square feet.\nSo each petticoat costs 4 x 4 = 16.\nShe needs two petticoats, so that\u2019s 2 x 16 = 32.\nSo the total amount of material she needs is 96 + 32\nSo it\u2019s 128 square feet that she needs to buy.\nTherefore the total cost is $3 per square foot * $128\nThe total cost is $384.\n#### 384\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJenna is making a costume for her role in Oliver Twist.
