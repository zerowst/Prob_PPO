"[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTony decided to rent a small cottage.  The master bedroom and bath totaled 500 sq ft.  The 2 guest bedrooms were 200 sq ft each.  And the kitchen, guest bath and living area totaled 600 sq ft.  If Tony spends $3,000 a month on rent, how much money is he spending per sq ft of house?\n\nSolution:\nThe total square footage of the master bedroom and bath is 500 sq ft.\nThe total square footage of the two guest bedrooms is 2 x 200 sq ft = 400 sq ft.\nThe total square footage of the kitchen, guest bath and living area is 600 sq ft.\nThe total square footage is 500 sq ft + 400 sq ft + 600 sq ft = 1,500 sq ft.\nThe total cost for renting the entire house for one month is $3,000.\nHence, the total amount he spends per sq ft for the entire house is $3,000 / 1500 sq ft = $2.\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/721", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -49.46781897172332, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe total square footage of the master bedroom and bath is 500 sq ft.\nThe total square footage of the two guest bedrooms is 2 x 200 sq ft = 400 sq ft.\nThe total square footage of the kitchen, guest bath and living area is 600 sq ft.\nThe total square footage is 500 sq ft + 400 sq ft + 600 sq ft = 1,500 sq ft.\nThe total cost for renting the entire house for one month is $3,000.\nHence, the total amount he spends per sq ft for the entire house is $3,000 / 1500 sq ft = $2.\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/72157608949307424/\">@85714672</a>\n#### 2\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/85714672@N03/sets/721"}]}
