There are 15 people on the team. On the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets. On the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day by asking door-to-door. On the last day, they set up boxes at schools and got a total of 22 blankets. How many blankets did they collect for the three days for donation?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets, so 15 people gave 15*2 = 30 blankets.\nOn the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day, so they collected 3*30 = 90 blankets.\nOn the last day, they collected 22 blankets.\nSo the total number of blankets collected is 90+22 = 112 blankets\n#### 112\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.6337189078331, "len_probs": 111, "answer": "\nOn the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets, so 15 people gave 15*2 = 30 blankets.\nOn the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day, so they collected 3*30 = 90 blankets.\nOn the last day, they collected 22 blankets.\nSo the total number of blankets collected is 90+22 = 112 blankets\n#### 112\n"}]}
