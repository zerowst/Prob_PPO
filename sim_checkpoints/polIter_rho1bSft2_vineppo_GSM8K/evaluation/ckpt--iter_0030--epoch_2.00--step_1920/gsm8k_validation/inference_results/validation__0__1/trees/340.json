The 5 players, including Jess, play 5 rounds in which each player removes one block. In the sixth round, Jess's father goes first. He removes a block, causing the tower to almost fall. Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. How many blocks did the tower have before Jess's turn?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 5 rounds, the 5 players remove a total of 5 rounds * 1 block each = 5 blocks.\nIn the sixth round, Jess's father removes a block, so there are 5 - 1 = 4 blocks left before Jess's turn.\nJess then removes another block, causing the tower to fall.\nThus, there were 4 blocks - 1 block that Jess removed = 3 blocks before Jess's turn.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.289955396205187, "len_probs": 110, "answer": "\nIn the first 5 rounds, the 5 players remove a total of 5 rounds * 1 block each = 5 blocks.\nIn the sixth round, Jess's father removes a block, so there are 5 - 1 = 4 blocks left before Jess's turn.\nJess then removes another block, causing the tower to fall.\nThus, there were 4 blocks - 1 block that Jess removed = 3 blocks before Jess's turn.\n#### 3\n"}]}
