She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\n\nSolution:\nThe guests in the parking lot include 40 guests - 10 cars Dylan's parents brought = 30 guests.\nEach of these guests arrives in a car that is already parked, so there are no new cars parked.\nThere are therefore 30 guests in cars, each with 4 wheels, so there are 30*4 = 120 car wheels in the parking lot.\nIncluding Dylan's parents' cars, there are 120 + 4 = 124 car wheels in the parking lot.\n#### 124\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.731707081198692, "len_probs": 139, "answer": "\nThe guests in the parking lot include 40 guests - 10 cars Dylan's parents brought = 30 guests.\nEach of these guests arrives in a car that is already parked, so there are no new cars parked.\nThere are therefore 30 guests in cars, each with 4 wheels, so there are 30*4 = 120 car wheels in the parking lot.\nIncluding Dylan's parents' cars, there are 120 + 4 = 124 car wheels in the parking lot.\n#### 124\n"}, {"text": "\nThe guests arrive in 10 cars, with each car having 4 wheels, so there are 10*4 = 40 wheels.\nDylan's mother's car has 4 wheels, so that adds another 4 wheels, bringing the total to 44.\nSince Dylan's parents' cars are included in the 40 guests' cars, there are 40+4 = 44 wheels in the parking lot.\n#### 44\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nDylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend.
