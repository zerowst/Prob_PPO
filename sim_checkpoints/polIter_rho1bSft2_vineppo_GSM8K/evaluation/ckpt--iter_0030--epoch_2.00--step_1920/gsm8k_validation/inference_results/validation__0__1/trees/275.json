A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nSo the price of each model was 100 - 5 = 95% of the original price.\nTherefore, the school paid 95/100 * 100 * 6 = 570 for the models.\nSo the school paid 570 in all.\n#### 570\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.875184528529644, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nSo the price of each model was 100 - 5 = 95% of the original price.\nTherefore, the school paid 95/100 * 100 * 6 = 570 for the models.\nSo the school paid 570 in all.\n#### 570\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library, so they bought 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nThe school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe school paid 6 * $100 = $600 for the models.\nThe 5% reduction in price for each model means that each model was sold for $100 - 5% * $100 = $95.\nSo the school paid a total of 6 * $95 = $570 for the models.\nThus, the school paid a total of $570 + $600 = $1170 for the models.\n#### 1170\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
