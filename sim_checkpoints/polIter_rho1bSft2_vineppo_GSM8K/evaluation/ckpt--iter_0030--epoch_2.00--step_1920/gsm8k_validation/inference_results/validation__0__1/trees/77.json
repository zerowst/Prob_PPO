There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach machine therefore holds 180 coins / 2 coins/machine = 90 machines.\nErin had $90 total from the machines, so she had 90 machines * $0.25/machine = $22.50 from the machines.\nThis means she had $90 total, so she must have had $90 - $22.50 = $67.50 from the change she received from the machines.\nThis means she received $67.50 / $0.10/machine = 675 machines.\n#### 675\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.331905364990234, "len_probs": 184, "answer": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach machine therefore holds 180 coins / 2 coins/machine = 90 machines.\nErin had $90 total from the machines, so she had 90 machines * $0.25/machine = $22.50 from the machines.\nThis means she had $90 total, so she must have had $90 - $22.50 = $67.50 from the change she received from the machines.\nThis means she received $67.50 / $0.10/machine = 675 machines.\n#### 675\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nErin found a total of $90 in change, which means she had $90 in change / $0.25 per quarter = 360 quarters.\nShe also had 100 dimes, which is 100 / 10 = 10 machines.\nSo she had 360 quarters + 10 machines = 370 machines in all.\n#### 370\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
