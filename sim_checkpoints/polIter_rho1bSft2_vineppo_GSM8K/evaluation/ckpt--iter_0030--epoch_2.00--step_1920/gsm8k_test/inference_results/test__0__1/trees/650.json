At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?\n\nSolution:\nOn Tuesday, the pomegranates cost 20 x $20 = $400.\nShe got a discount of $400 x 10% = $40.\nSo, the price on Tuesday was $400 - $40 = $360.\nOn the second day, the pomegranates cost 20 x $30 = $600.\nSo, she got a discount of $600 - $360 = $240.\nHence, the difference in the prices paid is $360 - $240 =$120.\n#### 120\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.615443632006645, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nOn Tuesday, the pomegranates cost 20 x $20 = $400.\nShe got a discount of $400 x 10% = $40.\nSo, the price on Tuesday was $400 - $40 = $360.\nOn the second day, the pomegranates cost 20 x $30 = $600.\nSo, she got a discount of $600 - $360 = $240.\nHence, the difference in the prices paid is $360 - $240 =$120.\n#### 120\n"}]}
