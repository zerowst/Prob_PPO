Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?\n\nSolution:\nWhen holding the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nWithout the gemstone, she could throw it 1000 * 4 = 4000 feet.\nThus, with the gemstone, Polly could stand 1200 - 4000 = -2800 feet.\nThis means she could stand 2800 feet outside of the dragon's reach.\n#### 2800\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.019655302166939, "len_probs": 119, "answer": "\nWhen holding the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nWithout the gemstone, she could throw it 1000 * 4 = 4000 feet.\nThus, with the gemstone, Polly could stand 1200 - 4000 = -2800 feet.\nThis means she could stand 2800 feet outside of the dragon's reach.\n#### 2800\n"}]}
