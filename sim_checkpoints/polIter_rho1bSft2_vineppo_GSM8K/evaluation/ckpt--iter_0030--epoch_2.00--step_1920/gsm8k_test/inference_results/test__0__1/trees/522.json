Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?\n\nSolution:\nBobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so he picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so she picks 2*5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than does Kathy, so he picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a combined total of (6 + 5 + 10 + 8) = 39 quarts per hour.\n#### 39\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -7.796494111418724, "len_probs": 148, "answer": "\nBobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so he picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so she picks 2*5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than does Kathy, so he picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a combined total of (6 + 5 + 10 + 8) = 39 quarts per hour.\n#### 39\n"}, {"text": "\nBobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so he picks 6-1=5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many as Bobby, so she can pick 2*5=10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so he picks 10-2=8 quarts per hour.\nTony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick in total 6+5+10+8=31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIt's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.
