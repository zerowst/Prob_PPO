The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe eldest had $18/3= $6 before adding more money.\nHe added $5 to his share and another $10 the next day, so he had a total of $6 + $5 + $10 = $21.\nHe spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.\nHe then tripled his amount, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.\n#### 39\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.43858253210783, "len_probs": 108, "answer": "\nThe eldest had $18/3= $6 before adding more money.\nHe added $5 to his share and another $10 the next day, so he had a total of $6 + $5 + $10 = $21.\nHe spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.\nHe then tripled his amount, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.\n#### 39\n"}]}
