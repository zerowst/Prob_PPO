He got a special introductory deal where the first 6 months were $8 a month, then it went up to the normal price of $12 a month. After 8 months of the normal rate, the service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?\n\nSolution:\nThe first 6 months were $8 a month, so that's 6*8 = $48\nThe next 8 months were $12 a month, so that's 8*12 = $96\nThe first 14 months were $12 a month, so that's 14*12 = $168\nSo the first 28 months were $48 + $96 + $168 = $302\nSo the 2 years cost 2*24 = 48 months\nSo the cost for 2 years is 48*14 = $672\n#### 672\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.24008186906576, "len_probs": 150, "answer": "\nThe first 6 months were $8 a month, so that's 6*8 = $48\nThe next 8 months were $12 a month, so that's 8*12 = $96\nThe first 14 months were $12 a month, so that's 14*12 = $168\nSo the first 28 months were $48 + $96 + $168 = $302\nSo the 2 years cost 2*24 = 48 months\nSo the cost for 2 years is 48*14 = $672\n#### 672\n"}]}
