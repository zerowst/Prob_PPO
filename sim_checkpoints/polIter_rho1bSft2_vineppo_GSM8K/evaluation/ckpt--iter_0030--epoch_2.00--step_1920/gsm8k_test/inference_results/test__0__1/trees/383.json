If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.\nEach pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she made 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.\nShe sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she makes 36 * 1 = 36 dollars from selling lemonade.\nShe sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open, so she sells 4 * 60 = 240 cups of lemonade in an hour.\nThus, she makes a profit of 36 - 240 = -104 dollars per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.\nSince she makes a loss of $104 per hour, her profit per hour is her loss of $104, so her profit per hour is $104.\n#### 104\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.41545782238245, "len_probs": 221, "answer": "\nMillie spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.\nEach pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she made 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.\nShe sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she makes 36 * 1 = 36 dollars from selling lemonade.\nShe sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open, so she sells 4 * 60 = 240 cups of lemonade in an hour.\nThus, she makes a profit of 36 - 240 = -104 dollars per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.\nSince she makes a loss of $104 per hour, her profit per hour is her loss of $104, so her profit per hour is $104.\n#### 104\n"}, {"text": "\nMillie spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
