If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?\n\nSolution:\nFor the next two days, Sadie slept 2 hours less, each, than she slept on Monday. This means she slept 2*2 = 4 hours less.\nThis means she slept a total of 8-4 = 4 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nFor the rest of the week, she slept 1 more hour than she slept on those two days. This means she slept a total of 4+1 = 5 hours on Thursday and Friday.\nAltogether, she slept 5+4+4 = 13 hours.\n#### 13\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.74181804805994, "len_probs": 139, "answer": "\nFor the next two days, Sadie slept 2 hours less, each, than she slept on Monday.
