One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne apple costs 0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * 0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so they cost 3 * 1 = $3 per piece.\nSo one crate of fruit consists of 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 pieces of bananas,\n12 * 1 = 12 pieces of apples, and\n7 * 3 = 21 pieces of oranges.\nThat means one crate of fruit costs 2.5 * 0.5 + 12 * 1 + 21 * 3 = $15.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.846445057541132, "len_probs": 157, "answer": "\nOne apple costs 0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 * 0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so they cost 3 * 1 = $3 per piece.\nSo one crate of fruit consists of 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 pieces of bananas,\n12 * 1 = 12 pieces of apples, and\n7 * 3 = 21 pieces of oranges.\nThat means one crate of fruit costs 2.5 * 0.5 + 12 * 1 + 21 * 3 = $15.\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nOne apple costs $0.5, so 12 apples cost 12 * 0.5 = $6.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nSo one crate of apples costs 5 * 1 = $5.\nOne orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.\nSo one crate of oranges costs 7 * 3 = $21.\nThus, a crate of fruit consists of 5 + 12 + 7 = 24 pieces of fruit.\nTherefore the total price is 24 * (5 + 1 + 7) = $168.\n#### 168\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
