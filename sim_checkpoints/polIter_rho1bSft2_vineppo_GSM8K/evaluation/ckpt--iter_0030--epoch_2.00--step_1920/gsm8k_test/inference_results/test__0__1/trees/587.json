On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, \"This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\"  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of red jelly beans, y be the number of blue jelly beans, and z be the number of green jelly beans. We know that x + y + z = 4500.\nWe also know that x - y = 0.01y (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans).\nAnd z + y = 0.01x (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get z + y = 0.01y + 0.01y = 0.02y.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get x - 0.02y = 0.01y.\nSubstituting the third equation into the second equation, we get z + 0.02y = 0.01x.\nSubstituting the first equation into the third equation, we get 0.02y + 0.02y = 0.01x + 0.01x.\nSimplifying, we get 0.04y = 0.02x + 0.01x.\nSimplifying, we get 0.04y = 0.03x.\nDividing both sides by 0.03, we get 1.333y = 0.03x.\nDividing both sides by 0.03, we get 411y = x.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get 411y + y + z = 4500.\nSubstituting 411y = x, we get 411y + y + z = 4500.\nSubstituting 411y = x, we get 411y + y + 411y = 4500.\nSimplifying, we get 823y = 4500.\nDividing both sides by 823, we get y = 5.53.\nSubstituting this into 411y + y + z = 4500, we get 411(5.53) + 5.53 + z = 4500.\nSimplifying, we get 2214.33 + 5.53 + z = 4500.\nSubtracting 2214.33 + 5.53 from both sides, we get z = 4500 - 2214.33 - 5.53 = 1231.67.\nTherefore, the jar contains 1231.67 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.\n#### 1231.67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -49.11673792824149, "len_probs": 670, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of red jelly beans, y be the number of blue jelly beans, and z be the number of green jelly beans.
