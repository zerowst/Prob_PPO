How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 3*2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 2 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 4*2 = 8 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was off for 2 hours, so it did not cool it any further.\nThe final temperature was 2 degrees higher than the starting temperature, so 2+8 = 10 degrees.\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 6 degrees and warmed it 8 degrees, for a net cooling effect of -2 degrees.\nThus, the final temperature was 10-2 = 8 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.246433887630701, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 3*2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 2 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 4*2 = 8 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was off for 2 hours, so it did not cool it any further.\nThe final temperature was 2 degrees higher than the starting temperature, so 2+8 = 10 degrees.\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 6 degrees and warmed it 8 degrees, for a net cooling effect of -2 degrees.\nThus, the final temperature was 10-2 = 8 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 8\n"}, {"text": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cooled 2*3=6 degrees.\nIt warmed the room up 2 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it warmed 2*4=8 degrees.\nThus, the temperature was 6+8=14 degrees after the air conditioner was turned on and off.\nIt was then turned off for 2 hours, so it cooled the temperature by 2*2=4 degrees.\nThus, the temperature was 14-4=10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 10\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high.
