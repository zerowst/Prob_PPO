Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?\n\nSolution:\nNewton picked up 2 apples, threw one away, and then threw another one into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. So in total, Newton had 2+1+5=8 apples.\nHe then picked up all but one of the remaining apples, which was a total of 8-1=7 apples.\nHe then threw this remaining apple away, and went home to make a pie. This means he brought home a total of 7 apples.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.43597763031721, "len_probs": 118, "answer": "\nNewton picked up 2 apples, threw one away, and then threw another one into the tree.
