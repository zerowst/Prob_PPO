They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran the field 15*2=30 times.\nKelly ran the field a total of 15+40*34=1425 yards.\nBlake ran 100*30=3000 yards.\nKelly ran 100*34+1425=14675 yards.\nKelly ran 14675-3000=11675 yards farther than Blake.\n#### 11675\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.848945453763008, "len_probs": 122, "answer": "\nBlake ran the field 15*2=30 times.\nKelly ran the field a total of 15+40*34=1425 yards.\nBlake ran 100*30=3000 yards.\nKelly ran 100*34+1425=14675 yards.\nKelly ran 14675-3000=11675 yards farther than Blake.\n#### 11675\n"}]}
