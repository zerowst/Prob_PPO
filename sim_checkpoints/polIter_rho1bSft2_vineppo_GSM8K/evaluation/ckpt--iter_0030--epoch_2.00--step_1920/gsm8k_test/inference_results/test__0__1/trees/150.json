If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?\n\nSolution:\nSteve's speed is 440 feet per minute. To find how long it takes Steve to get to school, we divide the distance he lives from by his speed: 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = 0.007142857142857142 minutes.\nTim's speed is 264 feet per minute. To find how long it takes Tim to get to school, we divide the distance he lives from by his speed: 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 0.007142857142857142 minutes.\nSince the winner is the one who finishes first, we subtract Tim's time from Steve's time to find the difference: 0.007142857142857142 - 0.007142857142857142 = 0.0000000000000001 minutes.\nTherefore, Steve will be waiting for the winner 1 minute before they finish the race.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.366219393908978, "len_probs": 264, "answer": "\nSteve's speed is 440 feet per minute.
