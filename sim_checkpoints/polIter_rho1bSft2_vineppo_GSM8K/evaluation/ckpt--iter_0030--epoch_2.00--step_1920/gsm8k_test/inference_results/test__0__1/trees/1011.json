How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 * 1/4 * 18000 = 1350 gallons of water on the first day.\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 1350 = 450 gallons of water on the second day.\nTogether, they pumped 4500 + 3000 + 450 = 7950 gallons of water on the second day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 7950 = 10050 gallons of water left to be pumped on the second day.\nOn the third day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 10050 = 2512.5 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 450 = 150 gallons of water on the third day.\nTogether, they pumped 2512.5 + 150 = 2662.5 gallons of water on the third day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 2662.5 = 15337.5 gallons of water left to be pumped on the third day.\nOn the fourth day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 2662.5 = 1773.1666666666667 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 450 = 150 gallons of water on the fourth day.\nTogether, they pumped 1773.1666666666667 + 150 = 1923.1666666666667 gallons of water on the fourth day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 1923.1666666666667 = 16076.833333333334 gallons of water left to be pumped on the fourth day.\nOn the fifth day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 16076.833333333334 = 4019.409090909091 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 150 = 50 gallons of water on the fifth day.\nTogether, they pumped 4019.409090909091 + 50 = 4069.409090909091 gallons of water on the fifth day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 4069.409090909091 = 13930.590909090909 gallons of water left to be pumped on the fifth day.\nOn the sixth day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 13930.590909090909 = 3482.6747242424243 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 50 = 16.666666666666667 gallons of water on the sixth day.\nTogether, they pumped 3482.6747242424243 + 16.666666666666667 = 3500.3413909090909 gallons of water on the sixth day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 3500.3413909090909 = 14509.658609090909 gallons of water left to be pump", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -30.423420697450638, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nOn the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 * 1/4 * 18000 = 1350 gallons of water on the first day.\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 1350 = 450 gallons of water on the second day.\nTogether, they pumped 4500 + 3000 + 450 = 7950 gallons of water on the second day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 7950 = 10050 gallons of water left to be pumped on the second day.\nOn the third day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 10050 = 2512.5 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 450 = 150 gallons of water on the third day.\nTogether, they pumped 2512.5 + 150 = 2662.5 gallons of water on the third day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 2662.5 = 15337.5 gallons of water left to be pumped on the third day.\nOn the fourth day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 2662.5 = 1773.1666666666667 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 450 = 150 gallons of water on the fourth day.\nTogether, they pumped 1773.1666666666667 + 150 = 1923.1666666666667 gallons of water on the fourth day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 1923.1666666666667 = 16076.833333333334 gallons of water left to be pumped on the fourth day.\nOn the fifth day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 16076.833333333334 = 4019.409090909091 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 150 = 50 gallons of water on the fifth day.\nTogether, they pumped 4019.409090909091 + 50 = 4069.409090909091 gallons of water on the fifth day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 4069.409090909091 = 13930.590909090909 gallons of water left to be pumped on the fifth day.\nOn the sixth day, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 13930.590909090909 = 3482.6747242424243 gallons of water.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 * 50 = 16.666666666666667 gallons of water on the sixth day.\nTogether, they pumped 3482.6747242424243 + 16.666666666666667 = 3500.3413909090909 gallons of water on the sixth day.\nTherefore, there were 18000 - 3500.3413909090909 = 14509.658609090909 gallons of water left to be pump"}]}
