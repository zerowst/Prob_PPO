Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane flies to Greece for 3/4*2=1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, meaning the first plane takes 2/2=1 flight to France.\nThe second plane flies 2*44=88 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 88/2=44 trips to France.\n#### 44\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.11578831076622, "len_probs": 114, "answer": "\nThe first plane flies to Greece for 3/4*2=1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, meaning the first plane takes 2/2=1 flight to France.\nThe second plane flies 2*44=88 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 88/2=44 trips to France.\n#### 44\n"}, {"text": "\nThe second plane flies 1/4 of its flights to France, so it flies 2 * 1/4 = 1 flight to France per day.\nThe first plane flies 3/4 of its flights to Greece, so it flies 2 * 3/4 = 1.5 flights to Greece per day.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so each plane flies 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 flights per day.\nSince the first plane flies only to Greece, it takes 1 flight to France.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 44 / 2 = 22 flights to Germany in one day.\nThus, the first plane takes 22 + 1 = 23 flights to France in one day.\n#### 23\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
