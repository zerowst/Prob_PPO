Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nAfter two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so 0.3*120 = 36 watermelons were ready.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so 3/4*(120-36) = 36 watermelons were ready.\nSo in total, there were 36+36 = 72 watermelons that were ready for harvest.\nTherefore, there were 120-72 = 48 melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.41737598925829, "len_probs": 152, "answer": "\nAfter two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so 0.3*120 = 36 watermelons were ready.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so 3/4*(120-36) = 36 watermelons were ready.\nSo in total, there were 36+36 = 72 watermelons that were ready for harvest.\nTherefore, there were 120-72 = 48 melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\n#### 48\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter two months, 30/100*120 = 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.\nWhen Ashlyn came back two weeks later, there were 120-36= 84 watermelons left.\nIf 3/4 of the watermelons were ready, there were 3/4*84=63 that were ready to be harvested.\nThe number of melons that were not ready for harvest after two weeks is 84-63=21\n#### 21\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
