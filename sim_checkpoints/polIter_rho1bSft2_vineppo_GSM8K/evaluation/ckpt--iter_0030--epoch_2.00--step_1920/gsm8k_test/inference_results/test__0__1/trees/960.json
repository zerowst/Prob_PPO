They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?\n\nSolution:\nBy the end of the third day, the pirates dug ten holes + thirteen holes + eight holes = 31 holes.\nOn the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number they dug on the first day, so they dug 4 * 31 holes = 124 holes on the fourth day.\nBefore finding the treasure, they had dug a total of 124 holes + 2 holes (from the treasure chest) = 126 holes.\n#### 126\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.118552461266518, "len_probs": 121, "answer": "\nBy the end of the third day, the pirates dug ten holes + thirteen holes + eight holes = 31 holes.\nOn the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number they dug on the first day, so they dug 4 * 31 holes = 124 holes on the fourth day.\nBefore finding the treasure, they had dug a total of 124 holes + 2 holes (from the treasure chest) = 126 holes.\n#### 126\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first three days, the pirates dug ten + thirteen + eight = 23 holes.\nOn the fourth day, they dug 23 holes + 1 hole for the treasure = 24 holes.\nOn the first four days, they dug a total of 24 holes + 24 holes = 48 holes.\nOn the island, the pirates had 4 times as many holes as at the end of the first day, so they had 48 holes * 4 = 192 holes in total.\nOn the fourth day, the pirates dug before finding the treasure, they dug 192 - 48 = 144 holes before finding the treasure.\n#### 144\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map.
