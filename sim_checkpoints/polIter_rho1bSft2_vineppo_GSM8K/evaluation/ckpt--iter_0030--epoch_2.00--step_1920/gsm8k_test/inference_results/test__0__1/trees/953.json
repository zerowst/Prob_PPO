How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nShe went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 6 a.m. that day, so she was awake for 6-10= -4 hours.\nShe was awake for -4 hours, so she slept for 24-4= 20 hours.\nShe slept for 120 minutes in a day, so she slept 20*60= 1200 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so that is 38-15= 23 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, so she slept 1200-23= 1177 minutes.\n#### 1177\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.8821933940053, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nShe went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 6 a.m. that day, so she was awake for 6-10= -4 hours.\nShe was awake for -4 hours, so she slept for 24-4= 20 hours.\nShe slept for 120 minutes in a day, so she slept 20*60= 1200 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so that is 38-15= 23 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, so she slept 1200-23= 1177 minutes.\n#### 1177\n"}, {"text": "\nShe went to bed at 10 p.m. + 1 hour = 10:00 p.m.\nShe woke up at 6 a.m. + 6 hours = 12:00 a.m.\nShe was sleepwalking from 12:00 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 2:15-12:00 = 1:15 a.m.\nShe woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so she went to bed at 12:00 a.m. + 5 minutes = 12:05 a.m.\nSo, she slept for 12:05 a.m. - 1:15 a.m. = 10:10 a.m.\nTherefore, she slept for 10:10 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. = 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n#### 110\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room.
