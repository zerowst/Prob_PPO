On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first stop, 5 times as many people get on as get off, so there are 5*8 = 40 more people.\nThis means there are 40 more people on the bus plus the 8 who got off, so there are 40+8 = 48 people on the bus after the first stop.\nOn the second stop, 21 people get off, meaning there are 48-21 = 27 people on the bus.\nThen 3 times fewer people get on, which means 3*21 = 63 people.\nThis means there are 27+63 = 90 people on the bus after the second stop.\n#### 90\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.556233707815409, "len_probs": 159, "answer": "\nOn the first stop, 5 times as many people get on as get off, so there are 5*8 = 40 more people.\nThis means there are 40 more people on the bus plus the 8 who got off, so there are 40+8 = 48 people on the bus after the first stop.\nOn the second stop, 21 people get off, meaning there are 48-21 = 27 people on the bus.\nThen 3 times fewer people get on, which means 3*21 = 63 people.\nThis means there are 27+63 = 90 people on the bus after the second stop.\n#### 90\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first stop, 5 times as many people get on as get off, so 5*8 = 40 people get on.\nOn the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on than got off, so 3*21 = 63 people get on.\nThere were 8 who got off on the first stop, so there were 40-8 = 32 who got on.\nThere were 21 who got off on the second stop, so there were 63-21 = 42 who got on.\nThere were 40 who got on on the first stop and 42 who got on on the second stop for a total of 40+42 = 82 who are on the bus after the second stop.\nThere were 48 people on the bus before the second stop, so after the second stop there are 48-82 = -34 people who are off the bus.\nThe number of people who are on the bus is negative, so there are 34 more people on the bus than there were before.\n#### 34\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\n48 people are riding a bus.
