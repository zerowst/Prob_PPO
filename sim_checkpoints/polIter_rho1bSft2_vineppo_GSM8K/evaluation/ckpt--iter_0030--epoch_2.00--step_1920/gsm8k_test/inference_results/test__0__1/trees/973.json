half the number of states in the USA. What's the total number of states in both countries together?\n\nSolution:\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so if we let x be the number of states in the USA, we can say that 0.5x + 4 = India's number of states.\nWe can simplify this to 0.5x = India's number of states - 4.\nWe can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the decimal, giving us 0.5x * 2 = 2 * (India's number of states - 4).\nThis simplifies to x = 2 * (India's number of states - 4).\nWe can then substitute this back into the first equation to get 0.5x + 4 = 2 * (x - 4).\nWe can then expand this to get 0.5x + 4 = 2x - 8.\nWe can then move all the x terms to one side to get 2x - 0.5x = 8 - 4.\nWe can then move all the x terms to one side to get 1.5x = 4.\nWe can then divide both sides by 1.5 to get x = 4 / 1.5 = 2.6666666666666665.\nWe can then substitute this back into the first equation to get India's number of states = 2.6666666666666665 + 4 = 6.6666666666666665.\nWe can then add this to the number of states in the USA to get 6.6666666666666665 + 4 = 10.6666666666666665.\nWe can then round this to 11 states in total.\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.51244754344225, "len_probs": 433, "answer": "\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so if we let x be the number of states in the USA, we can say that 0.5x + 4 = India's number of states.\nWe can simplify this to 0.5x = India's number of states - 4.\nWe can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the decimal, giving us 0.5x * 2 = 2 * (India's number of states - 4).\nThis simplifies to x = 2 * (India's number of states - 4).\nWe can then substitute this back into the first equation to get 0.5x + 4 = 2 * (x - 4).\nWe can then expand this to get 0.5x + 4 = 2x - 8.\nWe can then move all the x terms to one side to get 2x - 0.5x = 8 - 4.\nWe can then move all the x terms to one side to get 1.5x = 4.\nWe can then divide both sides by 1.5 to get x = 4 / 1.5 = 2.6666666666666665.\nWe can then substitute this back into the first equation to get India's number of states = 2.6666666666666665 + 4 = 6.6666666666666665.\nWe can then add this to the number of states in the USA to get 6.6666666666666665 + 4 = 10.6666666666666665.\nWe can then round this to 11 states in total.\n#### 11\n"}]}
