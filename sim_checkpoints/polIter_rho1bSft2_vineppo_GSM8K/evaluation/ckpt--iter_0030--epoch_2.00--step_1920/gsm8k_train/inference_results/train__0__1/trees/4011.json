If it takes 1 roll to wrap 3 gifts and 1 roll to wrap 5 other gifts, if there is no wrapping paper leftover after Savannah wraps the rest of the gifts, how many gifts did she wrap with the third roll of paper?\n\nSolution:\nShe has 12 gifts to wrap and she has 3 rolls of wrapping paper. She needs 1 roll per 3 gifts, so she needs 12 gifts / 3 gifts per roll = 4 rolls of paper.\nShe has 4 rolls of paper and she used 1 roll per 5 gifts. She used the 1 roll to wrap 5 gifts, so she used 1 roll / 5 gifts per roll = 1/5 of a roll.\nShe used 1/5 of a roll and she used 4 rolls of paper, so she used 1/5 of a roll / 4 rolls of paper = 1/20 of a roll.\nShe used 1/20 of a roll and it takes 1 roll to wrap 5 gifts, so she wrapped 1/20 of a roll * 5 gifts per roll = 1/4 of a gift.\nShe wrapped 1/4 of a gift on the third roll of paper, so she wrapped 12 gifts - 1 gift = 11 gifts on the third roll of paper.\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.105902515351772, "len_probs": 258, "answer": "\nShe has 12 gifts to wrap and she has 3 rolls of wrapping paper.
