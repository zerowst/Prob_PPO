If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?\n\nSolution:\nJerry's household uses 1000 gallons for drinking and cooking, and 20 gallons per shower, so he uses 1000 + 20*6 = 1280 gallons of water for showers.\nHe has a pool that measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet, so it has a volume of 10*10*6 = 600 cubic feet.\n1 cubic foot of water fills 1 gallon, so he needs 600 gallons to fill his pool.\nSince he can only use 1280 gallons, he can only fill part of the pool. He can fill 1280/600 = 2.16 of the pool.\nHe can take 2 showers at a time, so he can take 2*2.16 = 4.32 showers.\nJerry can take 4 showers in July.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.4458427131176, "len_probs": 227, "answer": "\nJerry's household uses 1000 gallons for drinking and cooking, and 20 gallons per shower, so he uses 1000 + 20*6 = 1280 gallons of water for showers.\nHe has a pool that measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet, so it has a volume of 10*10*6 = 600 cubic feet.\n1 cubic foot of water fills 1 gallon, so he needs 600 gallons to fill his pool.\nSince he can only use 1280 gallons, he can only fill part of the pool.
