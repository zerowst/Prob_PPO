Pleased with her progress, she has decided to continue saving $276 per month, for 4 years. Today, Sheila\u2019s family secretly added $7,000 into the piggy bank. At the end of 4 years, how much money will be in Sheila\u2019s piggy bank?\n\nSolution:\nSheila\u2019s saving period is 4 years, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 months = 48 months.\nSheila is saving $276 per month for 4 years, which is a total of 48 * 276 = $12,248 per year.\nSo, she will save a total of $12,248 * 4 = $48,976 in 4 years.\nToday, Sheila\u2019s piggy bank has $3,000 + $48,976 = $51,976.\nThus, Sheila\u2019s piggy bank will have a total of $51,976 + $7,000 = $59,976 after 4 years.\n#### 59976\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.408489495515823, "len_probs": 192, "answer": "\nSheila\u2019s saving period is 4 years, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 months = 48 months.\nSheila is saving $276 per month for 4 years, which is a total of 48 * 276 = $12,248 per year.\nSo, she will save a total of $12,248 * 4 = $48,976 in 4 years.\nToday, Sheila\u2019s piggy bank has $3,000 + $48,976 = $51,976.\nThus, Sheila\u2019s piggy bank will have a total of $51,976 + $7,000 = $59,976 after 4 years.\n#### 59976\n"}, {"text": "\nSheila\u2019s family added $7,000 to her piggy bank, so she now has a total of $3,000 + $7,000 = $10,000.\nSheila will be saving for 4 years, which is 12 months/year * 4 years = 48 months.\nIf she saves $276 per month, she will save a total of $276/month * 48 months = $12,368.\nAdding the amount she already had saved, $10,000, and the amount she will save from her family, $12,368, we get a total of $10,000 + $12,368 = $22,368.\n#### 22,368\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEver since she was a little girl, Sheila has dreamed of traveling the world.
