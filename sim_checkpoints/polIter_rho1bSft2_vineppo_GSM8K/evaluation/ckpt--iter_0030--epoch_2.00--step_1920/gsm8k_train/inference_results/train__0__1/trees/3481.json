If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  Since each cylindrical structure contains 12 rooms, and there are three such structures, the total number of rooms in the structure is 3*12=36 rooms.\nIf the entire space station has 72 rooms, and 36 of those rooms are in each of three structures, then there are 36*3=108 rooms accounted for by the structures.\nIf the entire space station has 72 rooms, and there are 108 rooms accounted for by the cylindrical structures, then there are 72-108=30 rooms remaining, which must be the kitchens.\nThus, there are 30 kitchens on the entire space station.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.440628983080387, "len_probs": 188, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.
