Then he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far until he reaches the next intersection.  Then he walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route, before turning around and walking the same path all the way back home.  How many feet did Rich walk?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, he walks 20 feet to the sidewalk.\nThen he walks 200 feet to the end of the road.\nThen he walks double his total distance so far, so 2*200=400 feet.\nThen he walks half his total distance so far, so 1/2*200=100 feet.\nThen he walks 200+400+100=700 feet.\nHe turns around and walks the same path back home, so he walks 700 feet twice, for a total of 700*2=1400 feet.\nThen he walks half his total distance so far, so 1/2*1400=700 feet.\nThen he walks 700+1400=2100 feet.\n#### 2100\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.792270459234715, "len_probs": 206, "answer": "\nFirst, he walks 20 feet to the sidewalk.\nThen he walks 200 feet to the end of the road.\nThen he walks double his total distance so far, so 2*200=400 feet.\nThen he walks half his total distance so far, so 1/2*200=100 feet.\nThen he walks 200+400+100=700 feet.\nHe turns around and walks the same path back home, so he walks 700 feet twice, for a total of 700*2=1400 feet.\nThen he walks half his total distance so far, so 1/2*1400=700 feet.\nThen he walks 700+1400=2100 feet.\n#### 2100\n"}]}
