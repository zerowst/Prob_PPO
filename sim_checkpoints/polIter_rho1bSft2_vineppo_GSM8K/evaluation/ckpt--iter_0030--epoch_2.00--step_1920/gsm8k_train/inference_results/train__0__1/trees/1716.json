Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThe 21 students who paid the full amount each is 25 students - 4 students = 21 students.\nThe full amount is $50, so the 21 students paid a total of 21 students * $50 = $1050.\nThe 4 students who paid half each paid 4 students * $50 / 2 = $100.\nThus the 4 students who paid half each is a total of $100 + the full amount each student paid, $1050.\nSo the 4 students who paid half each is a total of $100 + $1050 = $1150.\nTherefore the class was able to gather together $1150 + the full amount each student paid, $1050 = $2200.\n#### 2200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.02431435137987, "len_probs": 195, "answer": "\nThe 21 students who paid the full amount each is 25 students - 4 students = 21 students.\nThe full amount is $50, so the 21 students paid a total of 21 students * $50 = $1050.\nThe 4 students who paid half each paid 4 students * $50 / 2 = $100.\nThus the 4 students who paid half each is a total of $100 + the full amount each student paid, $1050.\nSo the 4 students who paid half each is a total of $100 + $1050 = $1150.\nTherefore the class was able to gather together $1150 + the full amount each student paid, $1050 = $2200.\n#### 2200\n"}, {"text": "\nThere were 25 students in the class.
