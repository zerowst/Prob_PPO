Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?\n\nSolution:\nJob A's net income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.\nJob A's total tax is 20% * $30,000 = $6,000.\nSo, Job A pays $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 in total after tax.\nTherefore,\nJob B's net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.\nSo,\nJob B pays $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in total tax.\nSo,\nJob B pays $36,000 - $24,000 = $12,000 in total after tax.\nThus,\nJob B pays $24,000 - $24,000\nSo the answer is $0\n#### 0\n#### <\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johnchapman.co.uk/\">John Chapman</a>\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.234868951141834, "len_probs": 262, "answer": "\nJob A's net income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.\nJob A's total tax is 20% * $30,000 = $6,000.\nSo, Job A pays $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 in total after tax.\nTherefore,\nJob B's net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.\nSo,\nJob B pays $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in total tax.\nSo,\nJob B pays $36,000 - $24,000 = $12,000 in total after tax.\nThus,\nJob B pays $24,000 - $24,000\nSo the answer is $0\n#### 0\n#### <\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johnchapman.co.uk/\">John Chapman</a>\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nJob A = $15 * 2000,\nSo = 15 * (t)\nt = 0\nJob B\nJob B = $420,000 +\nNet income tax\n6000\nNet income tax\n$420,000 * 0.10\n$42,000\nNet income = 420,000 +\nSo the difference is \n$6\nJob A pays\nSo the answer is $6\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nNick is choosing between two jobs.
