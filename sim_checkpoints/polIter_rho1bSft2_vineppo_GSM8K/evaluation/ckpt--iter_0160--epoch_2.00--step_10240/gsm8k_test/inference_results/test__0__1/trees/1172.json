On Monday she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday she counted 3 puffs.\nOn Tuesday, after doubling the number, the number was 3*2 = 6 puffs.\nOn Wednesday, after doubling the number again, the number was 6*2 = 12 puffs.\nOn Thursday, after doubling the number yet again, the number was 12*2 = 24 puffs.\nOn Friday, after the final doubling, the number was 24*2 = 48 puffs.\nIn those five days, she counted 3+6+12+24+48 = 87 puffs. Rounded up to the nearest whole\nShe will have counted her entire lunch at 8\nHer mom\n#### 87\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.343519382178783, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nOn Monday she counted 3 puffs.\nOn Tuesday, after doubling the number, the number was 3*2 = 6 puffs.\nOn Wednesday, after doubling the number again, the number was 6*2 = 12 puffs.\nOn Thursday, after doubling the number yet again, the number was 12*2 = 24 puffs.\nOn Friday, after the final doubling, the number was 24*2 = 48 puffs.\nIn those five days, she counted 3+6+12+24+48 = 87 puffs.
