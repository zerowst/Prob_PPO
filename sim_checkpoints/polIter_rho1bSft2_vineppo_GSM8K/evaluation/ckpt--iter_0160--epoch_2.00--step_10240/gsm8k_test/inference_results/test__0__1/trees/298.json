Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?\n\nSolution:\nThe first bid was $200.\nThe next 5 bids were each $50 more than the previous bid, so each added $50\nThe total amount spent on these 5 bids was: 5 * $50 = $250\nAfter these 5 bids, the next three bids were each made at the same amount\nThree amounts to add $less than\nTheir total cost: 3 * x\nThe total amount spent on these three bids was: 3 * x = x\nThe difference between total\nThe final amount left was enough for the final bid\nSo, the final bid was: $200 + $250 + x = total\nx = 400\nSo the auction cost $400.\n#### 400\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -48.44151348620653, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nThe first bid was $200.\nThe next 5 bids were each $50 more than the previous bid, so each added $50\nThe total amount spent on these 5 bids was: 5 * $50 = $250\nAfter these 5 bids, the next three bids were each made at the same amount\nThree amounts to add $less than\nTheir total cost: 3 * x\nThe total amount spent on these three bids was: 3 * x = x\nThe difference between total\nThe final amount left was enough for the final bid\nSo, the final bid was: $200 + $250 + x = total\nx = 400\nSo the auction cost $400.\n#### 400\n"}]}
