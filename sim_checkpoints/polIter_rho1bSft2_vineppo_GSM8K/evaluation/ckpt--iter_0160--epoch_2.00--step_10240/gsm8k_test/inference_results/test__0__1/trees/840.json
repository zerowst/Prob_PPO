One has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left and the third one has 1/2 left. If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, what is the total length of the glue sticks that are not used?\n\nSolution:\nThe first stick has\n1/6 * 12 = 2 mm left.\n####\nThe second stick also has\n2/3 * 12 = 8 mm left.\n####\nThe third stick has\n1/2 * 12 = 6 mm left.\n#### 8\n####<\nSo the answer is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm. The total length of unused pieces is thus a sum of 3\n#### 16\n####<\n#### <a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/m_logo_small.png\">Oxford University</a>\n#### 16\n####<\n<script src=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/m_logo_small.png\"></script>\n#### 16\n####<\n####<p>Patrick has three glue sticks that are partially used.
