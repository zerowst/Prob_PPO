If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how many total days are in December 2015 since we don't know the exact end date, but we can use this\nNumber of Days = 2015 - 2014\n= 1\nSince it makes the math easier we know that 2015 will be a leap year. A leap year has an extra day, February 29.\nEach day in a leap year is also a day that we're counting.\nEach day in a leap year from now on will be a day we're counting.\nNext, we need to determine how many days until his goal date, July 19th, 30\nSince we know that there are 1 average day per month (ex.
