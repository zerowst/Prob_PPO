Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch piece of chalk = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches\nSo he has to recycle, because he can't write with less than a 2 inch chalk.\nSince 2.25 < 2, he used up more than 2 inches of one of his 5 inch long pieces, so he recycled.\nIf he had only used\n5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of the 5-inch piece of chalk\nso he would have to recycle after 2 days.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.71998664177954, "len_probs": 145, "answer": "\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch piece of chalk = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches\nSo he has to recycle, because he can't write with less than a 2 inch chalk.\nSince 2.25 < 2, he used up more than 2 inches of one of his 5 inch long pieces, so he recycled.\nIf he had only used\n5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of the 5-inch piece of chalk\nso he would have to recycle after 2 days.\n#### 2\n"}]}
