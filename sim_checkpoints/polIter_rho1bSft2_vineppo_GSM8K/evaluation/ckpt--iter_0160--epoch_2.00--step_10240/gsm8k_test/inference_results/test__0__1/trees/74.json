If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of pots of marigolds = $2.74 * 12 = $32.\nThe total cost of pots of petunias = $1.87 * 9 = $16.\nThe total cost of pots of begonias = $2.12 * 17 = $35.68.\nSo the total amount he made is  $32 + $16 + $35.68 = $83.68.\nHence you can make $83 how much he is making\n#### 8368\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.574699889868498, "len_probs": 134, "answer": "\nThe total cost of pots of marigolds = $2.74 * 12 = $32.\nThe total cost of pots of petunias = $1.87 * 9 = $16.\nThe total cost of pots of begonias = $2.12 * 17 = $35.68.\nSo the total amount he made is  $32 + $16 + $35.68 = $83.68.\nHence you can make $83 how much he is making\n#### 8368\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total cost of pots of marigolds = $2.74 * (12) = $32.\nThe total cost of pots of petunias = $1.87 * (9) = $16.\nThe total cost of pots of begonias = $2.12 * (17) = $35.6.\nSo the total cost is:\n=> $32 + $16 + $35.6 = $83.6.\nHence the answer given by him is $8 less\nSo the answer is 836\n#### 83\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nArtie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market.
