The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nSolution:\nLet x represent the unknown number of guests\nThe first venue costs = 200 +\nThe second venue cost = (x-the cost for attending guests here)*\n$25 per\nFood cost per meal\n= $5x\nThe two venues equal cost\n200 + (x-?)* (the cost of attending more than one person attendee here)=\n$25x minus $5x food cost\n200+\n$25x - $5x=\n$5\nSo, the two venues equal cost is x=$10\nThere, 10 guests\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -66.8676469065249, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nLet x represent the unknown number of guests\nThe first venue costs = 200 +\nThe second venue cost = (x-the cost for attending guests here)*\n$25 per\nFood cost per meal\n= $5x\nThe two venues equal cost\n200 + (x-?)* (the cost of attending more than one person attendee here)=\n$25x minus $5x food cost\n200+\n$25x - $5x=\n$5\nSo, the two venues equal cost is x=$10\nThere, 10 guests\n#### 10\n"}]}
