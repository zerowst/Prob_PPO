Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?\n\nSolution:\nThe cost of the hat is $25.\nThe cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat cost, or $25 x 3 = $75.\nThe average between the hat cost and the jacket cost is (the\ncost of the hat + the\ncost of the jacket)) /2\n= (25 + 75) /2\n= $45. The total for\nthe cost of the pants\nis the\naverage between the\ncost of the hat and the\ncost of the\ntotal\njacket cost\nbecause the pants is in a separate category\nhence\neach uniform = 25 + 75 + 45 = $160.\n#### 160\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -53.080875374376774, "len_probs": 166, "answer": "\nThe cost of the hat is $25.\nThe cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat cost, or $25 x 3 = $75.\nThe average between the hat cost and the jacket cost is (the\ncost of the hat + the\ncost of the jacket)) /2\n= (25 + 75) /2\n= $45.
