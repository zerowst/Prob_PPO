How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?\n\nSolution:\nBetty collected 30/0.01 * 5\n= 150 points.\nSo now he collected\nTom collected\n= 1\n+15\nSo he collected 16\nMarta collected 3 * 16 = 48 points.\nSo now he collected\n48\n+ 30\n= 78 points.\nSo far\nTom has 50+16+48 = 114 points.\nSo all of them missing <400\nSo the answer is 400\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.26883268728852, "len_probs": 131, "answer": "\nBetty collected 30/0.01 * 5\n= 150 points.\nSo now he collected\nTom collected\n= 1\n+15\nSo he collected 16\nMarta collected 3 * 16 = 48 points.\nSo now he collected\n48\n+ 30\n= 78 points.\nSo far\nTom has 50+16+48 = 114 points.\nSo all of them missing <400\nSo the answer is 400\n#### 48\n"}]}
