How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?\n\nSolution:\nA third of 600 is (600/3)=200 movies.\nHe can buy the series for $6*200=$120\nSo there is 6\nThere are 600-200=400 movies remaining.\nSo the numbers above are just the cost for the movies he wants to get in series\nHe also wants to buy books for the 40% of the remaining movies are older movies\nSo he has 400*0.4=$160 books.\nSo the total cost is $10 per movie so $10*400=$400\n#### 400\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -43.8368334248662, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nA third of 600 is (600/3)=200 movies.\nHe can buy the series for $6*200=$120\nSo there is 6\nThere are 600-200=400 movies remaining.\nSo the numbers above are just the cost for the movies he wants to get in series\nHe also wants to buy books for the 40% of the remaining movies are older movies\nSo he has 400*0.4=$160 books.\nSo the total cost is $10 per movie so $10*400=$400\n#### 400\n"}]}
