On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.\n\nSolution:\nThe second day was 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people at the beach.\nThe third day had a total number of twice the amount of the second day, which is 2\nSo total on the 3rd is ?\n2 x 70 = 140 people\nThe first day is a Monday, so the week has 6 days\nSo the total number of people he saw over the week is: 50+70+140 = 260 people\n#### 260\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.059668734669685, "len_probs": 131, "answer": "\nThe second day was 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people at the beach.\nThe third day had a total number of twice the amount of the second day, which is 2\nSo total on the 3rd is ?\n2 x 70 = 140 people\nThe first day is a Monday, so the week has 6 days\nSo the total number of people he saw over the week is: 50+70+140 = 260 people\n#### 260\n"}, {"text": "\nThe second day had 50*1\n2nd\n+\n0\n>\n2\n\nThe second day had 50+20=70 people.\nThe total number for the second day was\n70\n\u00d7\n2\n=\n140\npeople\n.\nThe third day had 140*2=280 people.\nThe total number for the week were\n50+70+280=40\npeople\nthat he\nsee\nin total\nthat week.\n#### 40\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nConor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun.
