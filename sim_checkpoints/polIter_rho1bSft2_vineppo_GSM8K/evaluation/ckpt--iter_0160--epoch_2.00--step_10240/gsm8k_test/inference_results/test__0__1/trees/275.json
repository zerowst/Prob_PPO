He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?\n\nSolution:\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines\nThe second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines\nThe second scene\u2019s total for 4/5 is\n60 x 4/5 = 48 lines.\nSo the total for all two scenes is\n12\nSo he has \u201chis\u201d lines from the first \u201chis\u201d scene, 108, 54 (his from second \u201chis\u201d scene), and 60, 4\nSo the total must be 108+54+60+\nSo the answer is 222\n#### 222\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.946287363767624, "len_probs": 147, "answer": "\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines\nThe second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines\nThe second scene\u2019s total for 4/5 is\n60 x 4/5 = 48 lines.\nSo the total for all two scenes is\n12\nSo he has \u201chis\u201d lines from the first \u201chis\u201d scene, 108, 54 (his from second \u201chis\u201d scene), and 60, 4\nSo the total must be 108+54+60+\nSo the answer is 222\n#### 222\n"}]}
