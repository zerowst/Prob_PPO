How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for the two implants without the crown is: $2000 x 2 = $4000.\nAdding the cost of the crown to find the new total, we get: $4000 + $500 = $4500.\nSince he already put a $600 down payment, he needs to earn: $4500 - $600 = $3900 more.\nThen, we can find the number of hours by dividing $3900 by his average earning: $3900 / $15/hour = 260 hours. To get his answer in the context of this problem, we can say he needs to work \u201cat least\u201d 260 hours to pay for the dental work.\n#### 260\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -51.62563885375857, "len_probs": 185, "answer": "\nThe total cost for the two implants without the crown is: $2000 x 2 = $4000.\nAdding the cost of the crown to find the new total, we get: $4000 + $500 = $4500.\nSince he already put a $600 down payment, he needs to earn: $4500 - $600 = $3900 more.\nThen, we can find the number of hours by dividing $3900 by his average earning: $3900 / $15/hour = 260 hours.
