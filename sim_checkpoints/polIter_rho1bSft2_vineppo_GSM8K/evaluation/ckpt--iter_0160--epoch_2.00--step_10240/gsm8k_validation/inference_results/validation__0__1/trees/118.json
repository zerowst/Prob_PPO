But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nSolution:\nThe Skipper sailed halfway to the destination, which is a distance of 1\nThus, on his first attempt, he sailed the distance: 1*20 = 20 hours of travel\nThe wind blew his ship backward, causing him to travel west instead of east, so that the distance travelled was: 20 x \nSince his ship was now in a position that was less than halfway to his destination, the distance blown in the westward direction was: 20 x \n= 6.67\n#### 6.67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.62746600061655, "len_probs": 129, "answer": "\nThe Skipper sailed halfway to the destination, which is a distance of 1\nThus, on his first attempt, he sailed the distance: 1*20 = 20 hours of travel\nThe wind blew his ship backward, causing him to travel west instead of east, so that the distance travelled was: 20 x \nSince his ship was now in a position that was less than halfway to his destination, the distance blown in the westward direction was: 20 x \n= 6.67\n#### 6.67\n"}]}
