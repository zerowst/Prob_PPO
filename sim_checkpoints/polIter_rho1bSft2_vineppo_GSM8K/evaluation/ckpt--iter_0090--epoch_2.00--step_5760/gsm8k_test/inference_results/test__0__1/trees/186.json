If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?\n\nSolution:\nIf 160 straws were distributed among the small rodents and each cage had the same number of rats, it would have taken 160 / (6 pieces of straw per rat * number of rats in a cage) rats to distribute the straws.\nIf 10 cages of hamsters were kept alone, and each hamster was given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straws distributed among the hamsters was 5 * 5 = 25.\nThis means that 160 / (6 * number of rats in a cage) = 2\nThe number of rats in each cage is therefore 160 / (6 * 25) rats.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.481711007654667, "len_probs": 172, "answer": "\nIf 160 straws were distributed among the small rodents and each cage had the same number of rats, it would have taken 160 / (6 pieces of straw per rat * number of rats in a cage) rats to distribute the straws.\nIf 10 cages of hamsters were kept alone, and each hamster was given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straws distributed among the hamsters was 5 * 5 = 25.\nThis means that 160 / (6 * number of rats in a cage) = 2\nThe number of rats in each cage is therefore 160 / (6 * 25) rats.\n#### 4\n"}, {"text": "\nIf 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents and each cage had the same number of rats, it is possible that all the rats in each cage received the same amount of straw (160 pieces).\nTherefore, 160 pieces / (6 pieces per rat * Number of rats in each cage) = Number of rats in each cage\n160 pieces / (6 pieces per rat * Number of rats in each cage) = Number of rats in each cage\n160 pieces / (6 pieces per rat * Number of rats in each cage) = Number of rats in each cage\nLet's say the number of rats in each cage is \"x\".\n160 / (6*x) = Number of rats in each cage\nIf the question states that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, we can say that the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is (5 * 10) = 50 pieces.\n50 / (6*x) = Number of rats in each cage\nBecause 50 / (6*x) = 160 / (6*x)\nThe 50 pieces of straw represent 160 / (6*x) - this is the same as the total amount of straw distributed\n50 = 160 / (6*x)\n50 (6*x) = 160\n300x = 160\nx = 160 / 300\nx = 4/3\nThe number of rats in each cage is 4/3, or 1 and 1/3 rats.\n#### 1\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRussell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents.
