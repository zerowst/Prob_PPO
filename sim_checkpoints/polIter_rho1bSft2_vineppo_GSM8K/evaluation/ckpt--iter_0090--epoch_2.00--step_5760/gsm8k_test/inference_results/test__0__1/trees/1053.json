She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?\n\nSolution:\nThe shorts were $10 + $5 = $15.\nThe shoes were originally $48, but on sale for $48/2 = $24.\nThe socks were $8 - $2 (coupon) = $6.\nSo Alison spent $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.\nShe needs to buy athletic gear, so she should spend money on that.\nShe spent $55.\nTherefore we have our answer, $55.\nAlison\u2019s shopping cart contains:\nT-shirt: $10\nshorts: $15\nshoes: $24\nsocks: $6\nThis is my answer.\nYou can find my other answers by using the search below.\n#### 55\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.032841481268406, "len_probs": 185, "answer": "\nThe shorts were $10 + $5 = $15.\nThe shoes were originally $48, but on sale for $48/2 = $24.\nThe socks were $8 - $2 (coupon) = $6.\nSo Alison spent $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.\nShe needs to buy athletic gear, so she should spend money on that.\nShe spent $55.\nTherefore we have our answer, $55.\nAlison\u2019s shopping cart contains:\nT-shirt: $10\nshorts: $15\nshoes: $24\nsocks: $6\nThis is my answer.\nYou can find my other answers by using the search below.\n#### 55\n"}]}
