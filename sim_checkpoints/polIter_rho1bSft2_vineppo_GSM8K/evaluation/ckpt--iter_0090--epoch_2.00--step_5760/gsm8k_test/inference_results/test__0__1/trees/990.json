The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 4 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 8 degrees.\nSo the final temperature was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe air conditioner would have cooled 2 more degrees per hour (since high was 3 degrees/hour more than low).\nSo the final temperature would have been 14 - (2 degrees/hour * 4 hours) =\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.49489490687847, "len_probs": 123, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 4 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 8 degrees.\nSo the final temperature was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe air conditioner would have cooled 2 more degrees per hour (since high was 3 degrees/hour more than low).\nSo the final temperature would have been 14 - (2 degrees/hour * 4 hours) =\n#### 10\n"}, {"text": "\nThe air conditioner cooled 2 degrees per hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed up 2 degrees per hour * 4 hours = 8 degrees.\nThe air conditioner did not cool or warm on the last two hours, so it did not change the temperature by those amounts.\nThe total temperature change was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe final temperature was 2 degrees higher than the starting temperature (as it was set to 2 degrees).\nSo the final temperature was 2 + 14 = 16 degrees higher than the starting temperature.\n#### 16\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high.
