It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?\n\nSolution:\nThe distance from the second city to the first city is 75 + (100 - 50) = 125 miles.\nThe distance from the third city to the first city is 125 miles.\nSo in total, the train travels 75 + 100 + 125 = 290 miles per trip.\nIt does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 3 * 290 = 870 miles per day.\nThe distance between services is 18,000 miles, so the train needs service every 18,000 miles.\nSo the number of days between services is 870 / 18,000 miles = 0.0492\nSo it goes between services 0.0492 days, or about 1 day, since you can't have a fraction of a day.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.413580909371376, "len_probs": 211, "answer": "\nThe distance from the second city to the first city is 75 + (100 - 50) = 125 miles.\nThe distance from the third city to the first city is 125 miles.\nSo in total, the train travels 75 + 100 + 125 = 290 miles per trip.\nIt does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 3 * 290 = 870 miles per day.\nThe distance between services is 18,000 miles, so the train needs service every 18,000 miles.\nSo the number of days between services is 870 / 18,000 miles = 0.0492\nSo it goes between services 0.0492 days, or about 1 day, since you can't have a fraction of a day.\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nThe distance the train travels from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, from the second city to the third city is 100 miles, and from the third city to the first city, it goes 50 miles less, so it's (75+100-50) = 75 miles\nSo it travels 3 times a day, so it travels a total distance of 3* (75 miles) = 225 miles\nIt needs service every 18,000 miles, so it needs service every 18,000/3 miles (225 miles) = 600 days\n#### 60\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA train travels between 3 different cities.
