long.\nThat is the answer to the question.\nThe other way to solve this problem is to say that since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, then we can say that Carl is 1+x=5+x, where x is the height of Carl's cane.\nThat's because the difference between how long Carl and Ned are is the same as the difference between how long Ned and Isabel are.\nThat is, 1 foot (Carl is shorter than Ned) + x= 5 feet (Ned is 2 feet taller than Isabel)\nThat is, x= 4 feet (Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned).\nSo, Carl's cane is 2.5 feet long.\nThe answer is 2.5 feet.\nThe other

because we can use the same reasoning to say that since Carl is 1 foot taller than the person who is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, and that person is 7 feet tall, then Carl is 1+2+x=5+x, where x is the height of Carl's cane.\nThat's because the difference between how long Carl and Ned are is the same as the difference between how long Ned and Isabel are.\nThat is, 1 foot (Carl is shorter than Ned) +
