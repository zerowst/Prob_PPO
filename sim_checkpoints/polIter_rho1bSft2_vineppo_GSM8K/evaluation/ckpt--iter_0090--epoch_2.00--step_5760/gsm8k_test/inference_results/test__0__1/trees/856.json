He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?\n\nSolution:\nMr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks and he has 27 students, so he needs to give each student 2 * 27 = 54 glue sticks in total.\nEach pack of glue sticks contains 8 sticks, so Mr. Jackson needs to buy 54 / 8 = 6 packs of glue sticks so he can be sure each student gets 2 and there are no leftover glue sticks.\nAlthough the glue sticks are in packs, Mr. Jackson can still buy a few extra to give to students who may not have received their entire pack. He buys another 1 pack of glue sticks, so he has to buy 1 pack of glue sticks for every student that will receive an extra sticker, but it\u2019s still the least amount of glue sticks he could have bought.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.393282525241375, "len_probs": 203, "answer": "\nMr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks and he has 27 students, so he needs to give each student 2 * 27 = 54 glue sticks in total.\nEach pack of glue sticks contains 8 sticks, so Mr. Jackson needs to buy 54 / 8 = 6 packs of glue sticks so he can be sure each student gets 2 and there are no leftover glue sticks.\nAlthough the glue sticks are in packs, Mr. Jackson can still buy a few extra to give to students who may not have received their entire pack.
