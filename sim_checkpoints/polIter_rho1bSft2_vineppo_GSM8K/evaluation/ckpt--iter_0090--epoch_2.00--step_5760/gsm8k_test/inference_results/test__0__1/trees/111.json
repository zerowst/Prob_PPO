The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how many times Julia\u2019s boat took on water for every ten feet she rowed. 2 liters / (10 feet) = 2\nNext, figure out how long it took Julia to row 20 feet. 20 feet * (6 / 2) = 60\nNow figure out how long it took Julia to row 64 feet. (64-16) seconds * (6 / 2) = 64\nNow add up the amount of water each time. 60 * (2) + 64 = 184\nJulia took 184 liters of water in 16 seconds of rowing.\n#### 184\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.74111970514059, "len_probs": 158, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how many times Julia\u2019s boat took on water for every ten feet she rowed. 2 liters / (10 feet) = 2\nNext, figure out how long it took Julia to row 20 feet. 20 feet * (6 / 2) = 60\nNow figure out how long it took Julia to row 64 feet.
