There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\n\nSolution:\nThe probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives everyone an extension is 60% (100% - 40% = 60%).\nThe probability that Marcus will convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension is 20% (100% - 60% = 40%).\nThe probability of all three events happening is 60% * 40% * 20% = 14.4%\nSo Marcus has a 14.4% chance to actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.\nThat's the answer to the question \"The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\".\nThe full answer is: 100% - 60% * 40% * 20% = 14.4%\n#### 14.4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.257521860301495, "len_probs": 199, "answer": "\nThe probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives everyone an extension is 60% (100% - 40% = 60%).\nThe probability that Marcus will convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension is 20% (100% - 60% = 40%).\nThe probability of all three events happening is 60% * 40% * 20% = 14.4%\nSo Marcus has a 14.4% chance to actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.\nThat's the answer to the question \"The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\".\nThe full answer is: 100% - 60% * 40% * 20% = 14.4%\n#### 14.4\n"}, {"text": "\nThe chance of a normal teacher giving an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%.\nThe chance of a normal teacher giving an extension and Marcus getting his homework turned in is 60% * 20% = 12%.\nThe chance of Marcus's dog eating his assignment is 20%.\nSo the chance of either of those things happening is 12% + 20% = 32%.\nThe chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50% - 32% = 18%.\n#### 18\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMarcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework.
