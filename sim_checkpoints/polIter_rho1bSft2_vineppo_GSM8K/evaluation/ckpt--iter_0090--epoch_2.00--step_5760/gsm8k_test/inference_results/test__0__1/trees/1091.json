The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples one day. How much did an orchard earn for selling this at $5 per bag?\n\nSolution:\nThe orchard sold 2000 apples / 10 apples/bag = 200 bags of apples.\nThe total amount of money the orchard earned is $5/bag x 200 bags = $1000.\nThe orchard earned the total amount of $1000 for selling the apples.\nThus, the orchard earned that it earned $1000.\nSo, the orchard earned the amount of $0 is the answer because it does not have a dollar sign in the question.\nIt is a typo. It should be \"The orchard earned the total amount of\" $1000 for selling the apples.\nThe orchard earned the total amount of the $1000 for selling the apples.\n#### 1000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.498691506683826, "len_probs": 188, "answer": "\nThe orchard sold 2000 apples / 10 apples/bag = 200 bags of apples.\nThe total amount of money the orchard earned is $5/bag x 200 bags = $1000.\nThe orchard earned the total amount of $1000 for selling the apples.\nThus, the orchard earned that it earned $1000.\nSo, the orchard earned the amount of $0 is the answer because it does not have a dollar sign in the question.\nIt is a typo.
