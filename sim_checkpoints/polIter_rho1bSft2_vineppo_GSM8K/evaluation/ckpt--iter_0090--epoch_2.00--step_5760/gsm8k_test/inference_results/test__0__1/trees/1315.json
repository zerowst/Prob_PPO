Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?\n\nSolution:\nAna and Jane spend 3 + 4 = 7 minutes per orange.\nIn an hour, there are 60 minutes, so Ana will peel 60/7 * (number of oranges he could peel in an hour)\nJane will peel 60/7 * (number of oranges she could peel in an hour)\n(number of oranges she could peel in an hour) - (number of oranges Ana could peel in an hour) = (number of oranges Ana will have peeled more)\n(number of oranges she could peel in an hour) - (number of oranges Ana could peel in an hour) = (number of oranges Jane will have peeled more)\nLet x be the number of oranges Ana could peel in an hour, and y be the number Jane could peel in an hour. We can now say:\nx = (60/7)*y\nAnd:\nx - y = (60/7)*y - y\n= (60-7)y/7\n= (53-7)y/7\n= 46y/7\nSo Ana will have peeled 46(number of oranges Jane could peel in an hour), which is (46)(number of oranges Jane could peel in an hour) more than the number of oranges Jane peeled.\n#### 46\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.36324453353882, "len_probs": 316, "answer": "\nAna and Jane spend 3 + 4 = 7 minutes per orange.\nIn an hour, there are 60 minutes, so Ana will peel 60/7 * (number of oranges he could peel in an hour)\nJane will peel 60/7 * (number of oranges she could peel in an hour)\n(number of oranges she could peel in an hour) - (number of oranges Ana could peel in an hour) = (number of oranges Ana will have peeled more)\n(number of oranges she could peel in an hour) - (number of oranges Ana could peel in an hour) = (number of oranges Jane will have peeled more)\nLet x be the number of oranges Ana could peel in an hour, and y be the number Jane could peel in an hour.
