How many medals have been given out for counting?\n\nSolution:\nIzzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\nTogether they have 17 + 22 = 39 medals\nThere are 39/10 = 3.9\nThey have given out 3 medals less than the total of 10 times.\nThis means they have given out the total of 10 * (the total medals they have)\nSo they have 3 medals < total medals\nSo the total number of medals they have given out for counting is 39.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.47931180894375, "len_probs": 128, "answer": "\nIzzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\nTogether they have 17 + 22 = 39 medals\nThere are 39/10 = 3.9\nThey have given out 3 medals less than the total of 10 times.\nThis means they have given out the total of 10 * (the total medals they have)\nSo they have 3 medals < total medals\nSo the total number of medals they have given out for counting is 39.\n#### 3\n"}, {"text": "\nIzzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\nTogether they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.\nThere are 10 times less than the 39 medals have been given out for counting.\nSo, 10 times less than the medals that have been given out for counting is 10 x 39 medals = 390 medals.\nAll the medals together are a 39\nThey are a 39 medals less than the 39 medals they have together.\nSo, the medals that have been given out for counting are 39 medals + (the 39 medals they have together)\nThat is the 39 medals are a (a 39)\nSo, they have 39 medals\nThere are 39 medals\n#### 39\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAli is a superstar counter.
