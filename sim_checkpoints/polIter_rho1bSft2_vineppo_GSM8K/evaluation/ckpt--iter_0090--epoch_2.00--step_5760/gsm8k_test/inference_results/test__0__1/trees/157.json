They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran 100 yards * 15 = 1500 yards.\nHe ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 2 * (100 yards) = 3000 yards\nHe ran 3000 - 1500 = 1500 more yards than the loser.\nKelly ran 34 times to the 40-yard line, so she ran 34 * (2 * (100 yards)) = 8800\nShe ran to the 40-yard line 34 times, so she ran 34 * 2 * (100 yards) = 8800\nThey each ran 1500 more than the other.\nSo the answer is 1500\nTo be more specific:\nThe winner ran 1500 + loser ran\nSo the answer is 1500\n#### 1500\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.585881385952234, "len_probs": 222, "answer": "\nBlake ran 100 yards * 15 = 1500 yards.\nHe ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 2 * (100 yards) = 3000 yards\nHe ran 3000 - 1500 = 1500 more yards than the loser.\nKelly ran 34 times to the 40-yard line, so she ran 34 * (2 * (100 yards)) = 8800\nShe ran to the 40-yard line 34 times, so she ran 34 * 2 * (100 yards) = 8800\nThey each ran 1500 more than the other.\nSo the answer is 1500\nTo be more specific:\nThe winner ran 1500 + loser ran\nSo the answer is 1500\n#### 1500\n"}, {"text": "\nBlake ran the field 100 yards * 15 times = 1500 yards.\nHe ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 2 * 150 yards = 4500 yards\nHe ran 4500 yards - 1500 yards = 3000 more yards than Kelly\nKelly ran the field 40 yards * (34 + 1) = 1580 yards\nShe ran 34 * 2 * 150 yards = 10080 yards\nShe ran 10080 - 3000 = 7080 yards more than Blake\nAfter subtracting Blake's 7080 yards from Kelly's 3000 yards, we get a winner - loser difference of 400 yards.\n#### 400\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBlake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes.
