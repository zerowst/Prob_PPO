He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make 2x.\nHe made 16 more than he thought, so he made 2x + 15 + the 5 he dropped.\nBut this is the total number of cookies he baked: 2x + 15 = 16\nHe is left with 110 - 15 (the 15 he dropped) = 95 cookies\nSo x = 95 / (2 + 1)\nx = 95 / 3\nx = 31\nHenry baked this many last year: 31\n#### 31\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.559360414743423, "len_probs": 151, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make 2x.\nHe made 16 more than he thought, so he made 2x + 15 + the 5 he dropped.\nBut this is the total number of cookies he baked: 2x + 15 = 16\nHe is left with 110 - 15 (the 15 he dropped) = 95 cookies\nSo x = 95 / (2 + 1)\nx = 95 / 3\nx = 31\nHenry baked this many last year: 31\n#### 31\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make 2x.\nHe made 15 more than he meant to, so he has 15 + (number he made 15 more for) =\n(number he made - 15) + (number he made 15 more for)\nThis equals 15 + (number he made - 15)\nWe can now set this equal to 110:\n2x + (number he made - 15) = 110\nWe can now replace \"2x\" with the expression we found above:\n2x + (number he made - 15) = 110\n(number he made - 15) = 110 - 2x\nWe can now replace \"number he made\" with x:\n(x - 15) = 110 - 2x\nNow we can solve for x:\n3x = 125\nx = 125 / 3\nx = 42\nHenry baked 42 cookies last year.\n#### 42\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nHenry is making cookies for a local baking competition.
