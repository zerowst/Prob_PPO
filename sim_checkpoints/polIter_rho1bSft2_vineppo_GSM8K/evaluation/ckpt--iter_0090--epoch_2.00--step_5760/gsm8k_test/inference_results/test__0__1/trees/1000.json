He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?\n\nSolution:\nDoctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, and each takes 20 minutes of his time, so he has to spend 9 * 20 = 180 minutes on inpatients.\nHe also has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes of his time, so he has to spend 10 * 30 = 300 minutes on appointments.\nSo far, he has 180 + 300 = 480 minutes of his time that he has used.\nSince he has 960 minutes in a day (24 hours), and 480 is what he has used, he will be short of time by 960 - 480 = 480 minutes\nA day has 60 minutes, so 480 minutes is 480/60 = 8 hours\nDoctor Jones will be short of time by his appointment, so he will be late for 8 hours.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.838423371315002, "len_probs": 226, "answer": "\nDoctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, and each takes 20 minutes of his time, so he has to spend 9 * 20 = 180 minutes on inpatients.\nHe also has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes of his time, so he has to spend 10 * 30 = 300 minutes on appointments.\nSo far, he has 180 + 300 = 480 minutes of his time that he has used.\nSince he has 960 minutes in a day (24 hours), and 480 is what he has used, he will be short of time by 960 - 480 = 480 minutes\nA day has 60 minutes, so 480 minutes is 480/60 = 8 hours\nDoctor Jones will be short of time by his appointment, so he will be late for 8 hours.\n#### 8\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the total time he spends on rounds: 20 minutes/inpatient * 10 inpatients = 200\nThen find the total time he spends on appointments: 30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = 300\nNow add those two quantities to the time he spent at the clinic to find his total time spent: 200 + 300 = 500\nNow divide that time by the hourly rate he's working at to find how much time he has left: 9 hours * 20 (since 1 hour = 20 minutes)\nNow subtract that time from the 9 hours he's working to find how much is left: 9 hours * 20 - 500 = 4\nSo he'll have 4 hours remaining.\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nDoctor Jones is scheduling his time for Monday.
