each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, they each wrote 2*20 = 40 more stories.\nThe total number of stories for each person is 20+40(doubled), 40(doubled), and 60(doubled) for Alani, Braylen, and Margot respectively.\nFor Alani, she wrote 20+40(doubled) + 40(doubled) = 20+40+40(doubled)\nFor Braylen, she wrote 40(doubled) + 40(doubled) + 40(doubled) = 40+40+40(doubled)\nFor Margot, she wrote 60(doubled) + 60(doubled) + 40(doubled) = 60+60+40(doubled)\nAdding the total number of stories for each person in the second week gives 20+40+40(doubled)+20+40+40(doubled)+60+60+40(doubled) =\n20+40(doubled)+40(doubled)+20+40(doubled)+60+60(doubled) =\n120+2(40(doubled))+60(doubled) =\n120+80+60(doubled) =\n120+80+120(doubled)\nThe total number of stories after doubled is 120+80+120(doubled) = 220+120(doubled)\n#### 220+120(doubled)\n#### 220+120(2)\n#### 220+240\n#### 460\n#### _\n#### _\n#### _\n#### _\n#### _\n#### _\n####
