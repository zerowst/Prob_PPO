16 = $3\nAverage loss:\n= (total loss) / (number of races)\n= 3 / 3\n= $1.\n#### 1\n\\end{array}\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n</div>\n</body>\n```\n\n#### 1\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -18.508279770612717, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nTwice the amount he previously lost is 2 * 5 = $10.\nSo he won $10 + 1 = 11 on the second race.\nHe lost 1.5 * 11 = 16 on the third race.\nIn total, he lost 5 + 11 -
