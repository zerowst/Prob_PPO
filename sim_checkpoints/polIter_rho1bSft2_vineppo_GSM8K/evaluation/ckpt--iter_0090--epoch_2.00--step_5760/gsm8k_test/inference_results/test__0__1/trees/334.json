Problem:\nNick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun and Richard has 5 guns. If they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of guns is 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns.\nIf they split the 24 guns equally among them, each would get 24/4 = 6.\nEach of them would get 6.\nThe 6 guns they'll each get is the same as the 6 different people in the group each would get.\nSo the answer is, each of them would get a total of 6.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.94428013637662, "len_probs": 124, "answer": "\nThe total number of guns is 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns.\nIf they split the 24 guns equally among them, each would get 24/4 = 6.\nEach of them would get 6.\nThe 6 guns they'll each get is the same as the 6 different people in the group each would get.\nSo the answer is, each of them would get a total of 6.\n#### 6\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total number of guns is 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.\nIf they divide the 24 guns equally among their number, each of them will get 24/4 = 6.\nEach of them will get 6 guns.\nEach of them will have a total of 6 (since they are sharing)\nThey will each get a total of 6\nThey will get 6\nThey will get a total of 6\nThe answer is 6\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nNick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns.
