60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?\n\nSolution:\nHis house is 7*60 = 420 inches high.\nThe floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 3*60 = 180 inches high.\nThe roof from the second floor to the ceiling is 420-180 = 240 inches.\nTherefore, there are 240 inches of the roof from the second floor's floor to the ceiling.\nThat is the answer to the question in a single
