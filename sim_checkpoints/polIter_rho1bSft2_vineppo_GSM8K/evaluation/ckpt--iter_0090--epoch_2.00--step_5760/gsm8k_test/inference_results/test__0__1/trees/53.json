For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?\n\nSolution:\nOn Thursday, the mechanic earned $60/tire x 6 tires = $360 from truck tires\nAnd he earned $40/tire x 4 tires = $160 from car tires.\nSo on Thursday, the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520.\nOn Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any trucks, so he did not earn any truck tire revenue.\nAnd he earned no car tires, so he earned $0 from car tires on Friday.\nSo on Friday, the mechanic earned $0 + $0 = $0.\nThus the difference is $520 - $0 = $520.\nThe mechanic earned $520 more on Friday than on Thursday.\n#### 520\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.67202489823103, "len_probs": 196, "answer": "\nOn Thursday, the mechanic earned $60/tire x 6 tires = $360 from truck tires\nAnd he earned $40/tire x 4 tires = $160 from car tires.\nSo on Thursday, the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520.\nOn Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any trucks, so he did not earn any truck tire revenue.\nAnd he earned no car tires, so he earned $0 from car tires on Friday.\nSo on Friday, the mechanic earned $0 + $0 = $0.\nThus the difference is $520 - $0 = $520.\nThe mechanic earned $520 more on Friday than on Thursday.\n#### 520\n"}, {"text": "\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires so he charged 6*60 = $360\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 4 car tires so he charged 4*40 = $160\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires so he didn't charge anything\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 0 car tires so he didn't charge anything\nOn Thursday the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520\nOn Friday the mechanic didn't earn anything so he didn't earn more money\nSo the answer is $520 - (the difference between the earnings on Thursday and Friday)\nThe difference between Thursday and Friday: 520 - (the difference between the earnings on Thursday and Friday)\nThe difference: 0\n#### 0\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.
