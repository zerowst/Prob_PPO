How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (the number who like to bake + the number who like to play basketball)\nThis gives us: 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35\nIf the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we know that (the number who like to play music) is 2 * (the number who like to play basketball).\nThis means that (the number who like to play music), which is 15, is 2 * (the number who like to play basketball), which is 2 * the number who like to play basketball = (the number who like to play basketball).\nThis means that (the number who like to play basketball) is 15 / 2 = (the number who like to play basketball).\nSo, the number who like to play video games is 35 - the number who like to play basketball = 35 - (the number who like to play basketball)\nThis gives us: 35 - (the number who like to play basketball) = the number who like to play video games.\nThis is a very tricky problem that requires a good understanding of how to manipulate variables. It's important to note that the number who like to play video games could be any number less than or equal to 35, but this is a good approximation based on the information given.\nThe answer is the number who like to play video games is 35 - (the number who like to play basketball), which is 35 - (15 / 2) = 35 - 7.5 = 27.5.\n#### 27.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -65.37988107651472, "len_probs": 378, "answer": "\nThe total number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (the number who like to bake + the number who like to play basketball)\nThis gives us: 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35\nIf the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we know that (the number who like to play music) is 2 * (the number who like to play basketball).\nThis means that (the number who like to play music), which is 15, is 2 * (the number who like to play basketball), which is 2 * the number who like to play basketball = (the number who like to play basketball).\nThis means that (the number who like to play basketball) is 15 / 2 = (the number who like to play basketball).\nSo, the number who like to play video games is 35 - the number who like to play basketball = 35 - (the number who like to play basketball)\nThis gives us: 35 - (the number who like to play basketball) = the number who like to play video games.\nThis is a very tricky problem that requires a good understanding of how to manipulate variables.
