How much money would Sam have to spend to make 4 liters of juice?\n\nSolution:\nTo make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges, so to make 4 liters of juice we need\n4 x 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.\nThe cost for 1 kilogram of oranges is $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms will be\n$3 x 20 = $60.\nThis is the cost to make the juice. You can also use the formula for the cost of a job:\nCost = (Rate)(Time) + (Amount)(Rate)\nor\nCost = (Amount)(Rate)(Time)\nIn this case:\nCost = $60 (the amount is the amount of work done, or in this case, the amount of juice we can make)\nRate = $3 per kilogram\nTime = 1 (it takes one job to make 1 liter of juice)\nSo you can find the total cost by using the formula above:\nCost = (Rate)(Time) + (Amount)(Rate)\nCost = (3)(1) + (20)(3)\nCost = $3 + 60\nCost = $63.\nYou would spend this amount of money if you were to make 4 liters of juice.\n#### 63\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.848535653203726, "len_probs": 288, "answer": "\nTo make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges, so to make 4 liters of juice we need\n4 x 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.\nThe cost for 1 kilogram of oranges is $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms will be\n$3 x 20 = $60.\nThis is the cost to make the juice.
