To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?\n\nSolution:\nThe cost of the passion fruit is 2 pounds x $6/pound = $12.\nThe cost of the jackfruit is 1.5 pounds x $8/pound = $12.\nThe cost of the honey is 1 pound x $10/pound = $10.\nSo the total cost of making 10 jars of mix is $12 + $12 + $10 = $34.\nTherefore, Tim makes profit of $50 - $34 = $16 per jar sold.\nThus, for selling 10 jars, Tim makes profit of 10 x $16 = $160.\n#### 160\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.886755526065826, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nThe cost of the passion fruit is 2 pounds x $6/pound = $12.\nThe cost of the jackfruit is 1.5 pounds x $8/pound = $12.\nThe cost of the honey is 1 pound x $10/pound = $10.\nSo the total cost of making 10 jars of mix is $12 + $12 + $10 = $34.\nTherefore, Tim makes profit of $50 - $34 = $16 per jar sold.\nThus, for selling 10 jars, Tim makes profit of 10 x $16 = $160.\n#### 160\n"}, {"text": "\nTo make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey, for a total of 2+1.5+2 = 5.5\nHe needs to spend $6/pound for passion fruit, $8/pound for jackfruit, and $10/pound for honey, for a total of (6+8+10)/5.5 = 2.3\nHe sells each jar for $50, so he makes 10*50 = $500 from selling 10 jars.\nHis profit is $500-($2.3*10)=$500-23\nThe profit amount is $477.\n#### 477\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim makes a special honey and jam mix.
