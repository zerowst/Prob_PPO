The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?\n\nSolution:\nJulie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.\nSasha scored 6 less than Julie's score in the second game, so he scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.\nThus, Sasha scored 14 + 4 = 18 points in those two games.\n#### 18.\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -37.82137395441532, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nJulie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.\nSasha scored 6 less than Julie's score in the second game, so he scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.\nThus, Sasha scored 14 + 4 = 18 points in those two games.\n#### 18.\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bobby_mccall/8773544944\">\n</a>\n</span>\n#### 18\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://"}]}
