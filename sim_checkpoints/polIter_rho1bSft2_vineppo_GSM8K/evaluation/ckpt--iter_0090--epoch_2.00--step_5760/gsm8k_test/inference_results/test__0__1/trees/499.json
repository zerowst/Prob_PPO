The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of guests.\nThe first venue costs 200 + 25x (for food, which is an estimate of $5 per person).\nThe second venue costs 25x.\nSince 200 + 25x = 25x, the two venues cost equal amounts after food is included.\nTherefore, 200 = 5x\nAnd, x = 40 guests are necessary to find the cost equal.\n#### 40\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.945133537054062, "len_probs": 114, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of guests.\nThe first venue costs 200 + 25x (for food, which is an estimate of $5 per person).\nThe second venue costs 25x.\nSince 200 + 25x = 25x, the two venues cost equal amounts after food is included.\nTherefore, 200 = 5x\nAnd, x = 40 guests are necessary to find the cost equal.\n#### 40\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of guests.\nThe first venue costs = $200\nThe second venue costs = $25x + $5(x-the number of people who do not eat food)\nThe two venues cost equal: 200 + 25x -5(x-number of guests who eat food) = 0\n200 + 25x -5x +5(number of guests who eat food) = 0\n200 + 20x + 5x -5(number of guests who eat food) = 0\n200 + 25x + 5x -5x -5(number of guests who eat food) = 0\n200 + 25x -5(number of guests who eat food) = 0\nWe need to know the number of guests who eat food to solve this problem.\n#### 200\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.
