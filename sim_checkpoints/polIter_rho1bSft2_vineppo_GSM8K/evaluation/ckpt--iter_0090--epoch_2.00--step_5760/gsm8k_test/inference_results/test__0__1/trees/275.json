He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?\n\nSolution:\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.\nThese lines are 1/3 of the 54 lines, so 54 x 1/3 = 18 of the song\u2019s lines.\nThis means the song has 108 - 18 = 90 of his lines.\nThe second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\nThese lines are 4/5 of the 60 lines, so 60 x 4/5 = 48 of the song\u2019s lines.\nThis means the song has 60 - 48 = 12 of his lines.\nSo in total Sean has 18 + 48 + 54 = 120 lines to memorize.\n#### 120\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.56422434002161, "len_probs": 186, "answer": "\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.\nThese lines are 1/3 of the 54 lines, so 54 x 1/3 = 18 of the song\u2019s lines.\nThis means the song has 108 - 18 = 90 of his lines.\nThe second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\nThese lines are 4/5 of the 60 lines, so 60 x 4/5 = 48 of the song\u2019s lines.\nThis means the song has 60 - 48 = 12 of his lines.\nSo in total Sean has 18 + 48 + 54 = 120 lines to memorize.\n#### 120\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first scene has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.\nThese lines are 1/3 of the second scene\u2019s total, so they are 1/3 * (108 + x),\nThis gives 108 + x = 36, so x = 36 - 108 = -72 lines from the second scene.\nThe second scene has 6 + (4/5) * (6 + x) = 6 + (4/5) * 6 + (4/5) * x,\nThis gives: 6 + 24/5 + (4/5) * x = 36, so 4/5 * x = 6 + 24/5 - 36,\nThis gives: 4/5 * x = 18, so x = 18 * (5/4) = 27 lines in the second scene.\nIn addition, he needs to memorize his lines for the solo song, which is 54 lines.\nSo in total, he needs to memorize 54 + 27 + 5 (for the lines in the second scene) = 98 lines.\n#### 98\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.
