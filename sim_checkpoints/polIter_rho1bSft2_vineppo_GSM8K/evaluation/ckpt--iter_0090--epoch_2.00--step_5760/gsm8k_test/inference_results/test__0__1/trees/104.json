She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?\n\nSolution:\nPoppy places 1000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces on the board.\nSo there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.\nThen, her mom places 750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces of the puzzle.\nTherefore, there left 750 - 250 (her mom's addition) = 500 pieces.\nThe final number of pieces, which are not placed on the board, is the remainder of the puzzle pieces left after her mom's addition.\nSo, the remaining number of pieces is the same as the number of pieces left after Poppy's mom placed her, which is 500.\nThat's the final number, because the puzzle's pieces are not broken into smaller pieces.\nThere is 1000-piece puzzle left and 500 pieces left. The puzzle pieces are left in a group of 500 pieces.\n#### 500\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -57.98717663437128, "len_probs": 234, "answer": "\nPoppy places 1000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces on the board.\nSo there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.\nThen, her mom places 750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces of the puzzle.\nTherefore, there left 750 - 250 (her mom's addition) = 500 pieces.\nThe final number of pieces, which are not placed on the board, is the remainder of the puzzle pieces left after her mom's addition.\nSo, the remaining number of pieces is the same as the number of pieces left after Poppy's mom placed her, which is 500.\nThat's the final number, because the puzzle's pieces are not broken into smaller pieces.\nThere is 1000-piece puzzle left and 500 pieces left.
