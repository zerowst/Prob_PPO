If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost Ron: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the total cost of fixing the pothole to find Ron\u2019s savings: $450 - $120 = $330\nThen find the total cost of the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75\nThen subtract the cost of the asphalt from the total cost saved to find Ron\u2019s savings: $330 - $75 = $255\nSo Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.\n#### 255\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.14334224164486, "len_probs": 138, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost Ron: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the total cost of fixing the pothole to find Ron\u2019s savings: $450 - $120 = $330\nThen find the total cost of the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75\nThen subtract the cost of the asphalt from the total cost saved to find Ron\u2019s savings: $330 - $75 = $255\nSo Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.\n#### 255\n"}]}
