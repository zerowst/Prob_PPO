She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, which is 3 * (12 cups of lemonade / 1 pitcher of lemonade) = 36 cups of lemonade.\nShe sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she makes 1 * 4 cups of lemonade = $4 per hour that she spends selling lemonade.\nIf she sells all of the lemonade, she makes profit per hour = 4 - (cost of supplies / total sales)\n= 4 - (18 / (36 cups of lemonade / 1 hour * 1 hour)))\n= 4 - (18 / 36)\n= 4 - 0.5\n= $3.5 per hour\n#### 3.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.52289029955864, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nMillie bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, which is 3 * (12 cups of lemonade / 1 pitcher of lemonade) = 36 cups of lemonade.\nShe sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she makes 1 * 4 cups of lemonade = $4 per hour that she spends selling lemonade.\nIf she sells all of the lemonade, she makes profit per hour = 4 - (cost of supplies / total sales)\n= 4 - (18 / (36 cups of lemonade / 1 hour * 1 hour)))\n= 4 - (18 / 36)\n= 4 - 0.5\n= $3.5 per hour\n#### 3.5\n"}, {"text": "\nMillie bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, which is 3 * (12 cups per pitcher) = 36 cups of lemonade.\nShe sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she makes 36 * $1 = $36 per hour that she spends selling lemonade.\nIf she sells all of the lemonade, she will make an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open, so she will make an additional 4 * $1 = $4 per hour.\nHer profit per hour is $4 because she sells more than one cup of lemonade\nHer profit per hour = her total profit / the number of hours she open\nHer profit per hour = $36 / (the number of hours she opens)\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMillie decides to open a lemonade stand.
