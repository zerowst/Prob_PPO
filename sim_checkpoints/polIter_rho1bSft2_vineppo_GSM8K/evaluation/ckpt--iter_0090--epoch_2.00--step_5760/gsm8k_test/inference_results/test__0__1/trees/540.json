The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe eldest started with $18/3 = $6 after the first addition.\nHe then added another $5, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.\nHe then added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.\nHe spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.\nHe then gained $21 x (1/3) because he tripled the amount left after spending $8\nThe total amount he had was $13 + $8 (from spending) = $21\nHe has a total of 13 + 8 (from spending) after saving\nHe is now left with $13\n#### 13\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.97231451049447, "len_probs": 169, "answer": "\nThe eldest started with $18/3 = $6 after the first addition.\nHe then added another $5, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.\nHe then added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.\nHe spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.\nHe then gained $21 x (1/3) because he tripled the amount left after spending $8\nThe total amount he had was $13 + $8 (from spending) = $21\nHe has a total of 13 + 8 (from spending) after saving\nHe is now left with $13\n#### 13\n"}]}
