Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 = 1.5 flights\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those is 2 - 1 = 1\nThe first plane makes 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 flights\nThe other plane flies 44 trips, which is half the number the first plane makes, so the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips\nThe first plane takes 2.5 + x = 88 flights\nx = 88 - 2.5\nx = 85.5 flights\n#### 85.5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.57988664507866, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 = 1.5 flights\nThe remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those is 2 - 1 = 1\nThe first plane makes 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 flights\nThe other plane flies 44 trips, which is half the number the first plane makes, so the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips\nThe first plane takes 2.5 + x = 88 flights\nx = 88 - 2.5\nx = 85.5 flights\n#### 85.5\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 flights = 1 flight.\nThis means the remaining 2 flights are split between 1 flight to France and 1 to Germany, so each gets 1/2*1 = 1 flight\nTherefore, the first plane takes 1 + 1*1 = 2 flights per day.\nSo the first plane takes 2 flights * 44 trips (one for each country) = 88\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
