Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nAt the start, there were 120 x (30/100) = 36 ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons.\nAfter 2 weeks, there were 84 x (3/4) = 63 ready for harvest.\nThere were 84 - 63 = 21 that were not ready for harvest after two weeks.\nThat\u2019s what we call a \u201cdoubling\u201d problem. We can also solve it as follows:\nAfter 2 weeks, the number of unharvested melons is 100% - (3/4) = 25% of the melons remaining.\nThere were 120 - (some number x 100%) = 120 - (some number x 25%)\nSo, 120 - (some number x 25%) = 21\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.41799173504114, "len_probs": 223, "answer": "\nAt the start, there were 120 x (30/100) = 36 ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons.\nAfter 2 weeks, there were 84 x (3/4) = 63 ready for harvest.\nThere were 84 - 63 = 21 that were not ready for harvest after two weeks.\nThat\u2019s what we call a \u201cdoubling\u201d problem.
