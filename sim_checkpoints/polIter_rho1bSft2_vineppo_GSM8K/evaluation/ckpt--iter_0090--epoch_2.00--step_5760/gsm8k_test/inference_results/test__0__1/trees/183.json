One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?\n\nSolution:\nThe well-rounded team's first runner will run 400 meters in 55 seconds, for an average time of 55 / 400 = 0.1375 seconds per meter.\nThe next runner will be 3 seconds faster, so they will run the 400 meters in 55 - 3 = 52 seconds per meter.\nThe second runner will be 3 seconds faster than the first runner on the second leg, so they will run the 400 meters in 52 - 3 = 49 seconds per meter.\nThe faster team's runners will run the 400 meters in 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, and 100 meters respectively, for a total time of 49+52+55+58+61+64+67+70+73+76+79+82+85+88+91+94+97+100 = 1000 seconds\nThe slower team's fastest runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds, for an average time of 60 / 400 = 0.15 seconds per meter.\nThe slower team's runners will run the 400 meters in 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, and 96 seconds total, for a total time of 1000\nThe difference is 1000 - 100 = 900\nThe faster team wins by 900.\n#### 900\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.863005936145782, "len_probs": 515, "answer": "\nThe well-rounded team's first runner will run 400 meters in 55 seconds, for an average time of 55 / 400 = 0.1375 seconds per meter.\nThe next runner will be 3 seconds faster, so they will run the 400 meters in 55 - 3 = 52 seconds per meter.\nThe second runner will be 3 seconds faster than the first runner on the second leg, so they will run the 400 meters in 52 - 3 = 49 seconds per meter.\nThe faster team's runners will run the 400 meters in 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, and 100 meters respectively, for a total time of 49+52+55+58+61+64+67+70+73+76+79+82+85+88+91+94+97+100 = 1000 seconds\nThe slower team's fastest runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds, for an average time of 60 / 400 = 0.15 seconds per meter.\nThe slower team's runners will run the 400 meters in 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, and 96 seconds total, for a total time of 1000\nThe difference is 1000 - 100 = 900\nThe faster team wins by 900.\n#### 900\n"}, {"text": "\nThe very well-rounded team has a runner who runs their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds.\nThe other team's first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds + 3 seconds (for each of the other 3 runners) = 60 + 3(3) = 60 + 9 = 79 seconds.\nThe faster team's runners will run their 400 meter leg in 55, 55 + 79, 55 + 79 + 79, 55 + 79 + 79 + 79, or 55 + 79 + 79 + 79 + 79 = 350 seconds\nThe faster team's runners will win by 350 - 250 = 100 seconds.\n#### 100\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTwo track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.
