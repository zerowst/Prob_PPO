He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the house temperature: 5 degrees * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen add that to the starting temperature to find the new temperature: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen subtract the temperature of the air in the window (because the window is open) to find the temperature of the air: 55 degrees - (2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes) = 15 degrees\nFinally, subtract the temperature of the air from the temperature of the oven to find the final temperature: 15 degrees + (the temperature of the air)\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.96336204558611, "len_probs": 147, "answer": "\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the house temperature: 5 degrees * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen add that to the starting temperature to find the new temperature: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen subtract the temperature of the air in the window (because the window is open) to find the temperature of the air: 55 degrees - (2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes) = 15 degrees\nFinally, subtract the temperature of the air from the temperature of the oven to find the final temperature: 15 degrees + (the temperature of the air)\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find how much the temperature increased from baking: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.\nThen add this to the starting temperature to find the new temperature: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen find how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes: 30 minutes / (10 minutes/interval) = 3 intervals\nThen multiply the number of intervals by the temperature decrease per interval to find the total temperature decrease: 3 intervals * -2 degrees/interval = -6 degrees\nFinally, subtract the temperature decrease from the starting temperature to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\nMarcus' house's temperature after the baking and baking session is 49 degrees.\n#### 49\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
