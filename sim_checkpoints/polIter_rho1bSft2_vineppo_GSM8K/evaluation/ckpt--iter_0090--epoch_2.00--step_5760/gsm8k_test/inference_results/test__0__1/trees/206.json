He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times the distance.\nHe did that for 5 days a week * 20 times = 100 times the distance.\nThe distance is 25 kilometers, so the total distance for this part is 100 * 25 = 2500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times the distance.\nHe did that for 2 days a week * 6 times = 12 days\nThe distance is 60 kilometers, so the total distance for this part is 12 * 60 * 60 (distance = speed * time)\nThat's 12 * 60 * 60 = 43,200 kilometers.\nThe total distance for all months of the year is 43,200 + 2500 = 45,700 kilometers.\n#### 45,700\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.421343214809895, "len_probs": 248, "answer": "\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times the distance.\nHe did that for 5 days a week * 20 times = 100 times the distance.\nThe distance is 25 kilometers, so the total distance for this part is 100 * 25 = 2500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times the distance.\nHe did that for 2 days a week * 6 times = 12 days\nThe distance is 60 kilometers, so the total distance for this part is 12 * 60 * 60 (distance = speed * time)\nThat's 12 * 60 * 60 = 43,200 kilometers.\nThe total distance for all months of the year is 43,200 + 2500 = 45,700 kilometers.\n#### 45,700\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times the distance.\nHe did that for 5 days a week, so in total he rode 5 days * 20 times = 100 times the distance.\nThe total distance is 100 * 25 = 2500 kilometers.\nIn the next 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times the distance.\nHe did that for 5 days a week, so in total he rode 5 days * 6 times = 30 times the distance.\nThe total distance is 30 * 60 = 1800 kilometers.\nThe total distance Micheal rode was 2500 + 1800 = 4300 kilometers.\n#### 4300\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMicheal loves riding a bike.
