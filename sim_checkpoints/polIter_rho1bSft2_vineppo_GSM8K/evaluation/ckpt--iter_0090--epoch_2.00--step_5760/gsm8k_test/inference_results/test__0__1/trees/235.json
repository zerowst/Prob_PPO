John needs to buy 10 pizzas.\n#### 10\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJohn orders some pizzas to share with his friends.  There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure each can have 4 slices.  Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions.  How many Pizzas does John need to order?\n\nSolution:\nEach friend will get 4 slices, and there are 20 friends, so we need to work out 4*20=80 slices of pizza.\nEach pizza has 8 portions, so we need to work out how many pizzas fit into this, which we do by doing 80/8=10 pizzas.\nJohn needs to buy 10 pizzas to have enough for his friends.\nThis is because he can't buy 1 pizza and not enough for 80, because he is ordering a whole pizza.\nThis is because 1 pizza will not be enough for all his friends, and he needs to buy another one to have enough slices for all his friends.\nSo the answer is 10. John needs to buy 10 pizzas.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.23459754884243, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nEach friend will get 4 slices, and there are 20 friends, so we need to work out 4*20=80 slices of pizza.\nEach pizza has 8 portions, so we need to work out how many pizzas fit into this, which we do by doing 80/8=10 pizzas.\nJohn needs to buy 10 pizzas to have enough for his friends.\nThis is because he can't buy 1 pizza and not enough for 80, because he is ordering a whole pizza.\nThis is because 1 pizza will not be enough for all his friends, and he needs to buy another one to have enough slices for all his friends.\nSo the answer is 10.
