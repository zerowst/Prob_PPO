If she earns $5 per babysitting and babysitting 4 times, she will have made 5*4 = $20.\nSecond, we need to calculate how much money Sara will make from mowing lawns. If she earns $4 per lawn mowing and mowing lawns 4 times, she will have made 4*4 = $16.\nNow we will add these two amounts together, because we want to know how many times Sara must mow the lawn in order to make enough money to afford the jacket and shoes. So, 20 + 16 = 36.\nFinally, we subtract the amount Sara had saved before starting jobs, $10, from the total she needs to save, 36, to find out how many more times Sara must mow her lawn in order to afford the jacket and shoes. 36 - 10 = 26.\nSara must mow her lawn 2 more times in order to be able to afford the jacket and shoes.\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst figure out how much money Sara will make from babysitting: $5/time * 4 times = $20\nSecond figure out how much money Sara will make from mowing lawns: $4/time * (the number of times she mows the lawn she needs to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes)\nSince she needs to earn the same amount from both sources of work, the amount from mowing lawns must be equal to $20 (from babysitting).\nSo the number of times Sara must mow the lawn Sara\u2019s parents pay her for is: $20 / (the amount she makes from mowing lawns per lawn)\nSo the number of times she must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes is: $20 / (the amount she makes from mowing lawns per lawn)\nSo the number of times she must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes is: $20 / (the amount she makes from mowing lawns per lawn)\nSo the number of times she must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes is: 20 / (the amount she makes from mowing lawns per lawn)\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.
