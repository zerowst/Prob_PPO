$1 = $9\n$9 - $7.2 = $1.8 more paid for by Kelly\n#### 1.8\n</span>\n#### 1.8\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n</body>\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```\n```\n#### 1\n#### 1\n```", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -20.314970076084137, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nBecky paid 20 * $0.45 = $8.\nShe received a discount for a total of $8 * 0.01 = $0.8\nSo Becky paid $8 -
