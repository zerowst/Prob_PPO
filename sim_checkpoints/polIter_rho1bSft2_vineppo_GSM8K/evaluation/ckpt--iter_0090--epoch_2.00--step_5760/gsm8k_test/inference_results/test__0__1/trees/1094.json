She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?\n\nSolution:\nEllen took 1 soda out of a case of 12, so she has a 12/12 - 1/12 = 11/12 chance of getting a shaken soda.\nAfter Ellen took 1 soda, there were 11/12 * 12 - 3/12 = 10 soda left in the case.\nEllen's brother took 1 soda, so there were 10 - 1 = 9 soda left.\nEllen's friend took 1 soda, so there were 9 - 2 = 7 soda left.\nTherefore, Ellen's friend can get a sprayed soda from a shaken can in 7/12 * 100% = 58.3% of the time.\nSo the answer is 58.3\n#### 58.3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.515825673937798, "len_probs": 207, "answer": "\nEllen took 1 soda out of a case of 12, so she has a 12/12 - 1/12 = 11/12 chance of getting a shaken soda.\nAfter Ellen took 1 soda, there were 11/12 * 12 - 3/12 = 10 soda left in the case.\nEllen's brother took 1 soda, so there were 10 - 1 = 9 soda left.\nEllen's friend took 1 soda, so there were 9 - 2 = 7 soda left.\nTherefore, Ellen's friend can get a sprayed soda from a shaken can in 7/12 * 100% = 58.3% of the time.\nSo the answer is 58.3\n#### 58.3\n"}, {"text": "\nEllen started with a case of 12 sodas, got rid of 3, left 1 behind, and then Ellen's friend came along.
