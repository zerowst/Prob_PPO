She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 riders who can stay upright.\nOut of these, 7.5 x 0.6 = 4.5 riders are women.\nSo, there are 4.5 riders who are men who can stay upright on the wave.\nThis number can be rounded up to 4 men who can stay upright on the wave.\nThis number can be rounded down to 4 men.\nTherefore, 4 men can stay
