Question: How do you calculate the area of a triangle?\nAnswer: The area of a triangle is calculated by the formula: ", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBrittany and her mom go to the museum. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, how much money, in dollars, did she give the cashier?\n\nSolution:\nBrittany's mom paid $10 for an adult ticket and $12 for a child ticket, so her total cost was 10 + 12 = $22.\nShe paid $8 in change, so she gave the cashier 22 + 8 = $30.\nTherefore she paid 30 dollars, which is the answer for this question.\nSo the answer is 30.
