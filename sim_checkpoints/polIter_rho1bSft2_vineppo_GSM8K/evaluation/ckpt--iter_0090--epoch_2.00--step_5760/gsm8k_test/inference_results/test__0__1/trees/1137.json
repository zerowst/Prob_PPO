He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?\n\nSolution:\nAfter pouring the water, Donny's water bottle has 4 ounces of water and he is able to drink the water from his other bottle, so the second bottle must have at least 4 ounces of water to be able to drink the water.\nIt is not possible to drink from the bottle because it is not 40 degrees.\nThe bottle is 33 degrees because that is all that is left in the mug.\nThis is not enough to make it to the 40-degree threshold, so we have to find the temperature of the second bottle.\nThe bottle has 4 ounces of water and 33 degrees is the minimum for the water in the mug, so the water in the other bottle must be at least 40 - 33 = 7 degrees.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -51.18650156632066, "len_probs": 190, "answer": "\nAfter pouring the water, Donny's water bottle has 4 ounces of water and he is able to drink the water from his other bottle, so the second bottle must have at least 4 ounces of water to be able to drink the water.\nIt is not possible to drink from the bottle because it is not 40 degrees.\nThe bottle is 33 degrees because that is all that is left in the mug.\nThis is not enough to make it to the 40-degree threshold, so we have to find the temperature of the second bottle.\nThe bottle has 4 ounces of water and 33 degrees is the minimum for the water in the mug, so the water in the other bottle must be at least 40 - 33 = 7 degrees.\n#### 7\n"}]}
