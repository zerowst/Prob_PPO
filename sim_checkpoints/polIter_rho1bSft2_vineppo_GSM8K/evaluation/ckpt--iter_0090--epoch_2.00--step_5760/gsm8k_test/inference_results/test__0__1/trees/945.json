He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?\n\nSolution:\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nSo he took 12/2=6 hours to cross the lake\nHe took 6/2=3 hours to rest\nSo in total, he was away from the island for 6-3=3 hours\nHe was swimming at 2 miles per hour\nSo he took 12/2=6 hours to finish the remaining 20-12=8 miles\nHe was swimming at a speed of 1 mile per hour\nSo it took 8/1=8 hours to finish the remaining distance\nSo in total, he was away from the island for 3+8=11 hours\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.513698764145374, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nSo he took 12/2=6 hours to cross the lake\nHe took 6/2=3 hours to rest\nSo in total, he was away from the island for 6-3=3 hours\nHe was swimming at 2 miles per hour\nSo he took 12/2=6 hours to finish the remaining 20-12=8 miles\nHe was swimming at a speed of 1 mile per hour\nSo it took 8/1=8 hours to finish the remaining distance\nSo in total, he was away from the island for 3+8=11 hours\n#### 11\n"}, {"text": "\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nResting half as long as the swimming time, he rested for 60/2=30 minutes.\nThe total time for the swimming was 12/60=2/5 of an hour\nSo in total it took him 12+30=42 minutes\nThe total time for the swimming was 60% of the total time, so the rest of the time was 100%-60%=40%\nSo he swam for 40% of the total time, which is 42*0.4=17.6\n#### 17.6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJames loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.
