Problem:\nMax plans to watch two movies this weekend. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. How many minutes will it take Max to watch the two movies?\n\nSolution:\nThe first movie is 1 hour * 60 minutes per hour + 30 minutes = 70 minutes.\nThe second movie is 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.\nSo the total time is 70 + 125 = 195 minutes.\nTherefore the total time Max will take to watch the two movies is 195 minutes.\nMax will be able to watch the movies in the
