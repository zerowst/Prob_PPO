This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?\n\nSolution:\nThe first day covered 10 km, and the second day was 50 / 2 = 25 km.\nSo the first two days accounted for 10 + 25 = 35 km of the total distance.\nThus, on the 3rd day, he had to go 50 - 35 = 15 km to finish up the hike.\nThat's it, he was able to finish the hike on a third day.\nThis is the answer to the problem:\nThe 3rd day of the hike was 15 km long because 50 - (the first two days)\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.65787747502327, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nThe first day covered 10 km, and the second day was 50 / 2 = 25 km.\nSo the first two days accounted for 10 + 25 = 35 km of the total distance.\nThus, on the 3rd day, he had to go 50 - 35 = 15 km to finish up the hike.\nThat's it, he was able to finish the hike on a third day.\nThis is the answer to the problem:\nThe 3rd day of the hike was 15 km long because 50 - (the first two days)\n#### 15\n"}]}
