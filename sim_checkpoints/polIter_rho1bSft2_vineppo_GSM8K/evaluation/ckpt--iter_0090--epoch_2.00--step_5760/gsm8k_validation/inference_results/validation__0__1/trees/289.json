On Monday she sells 5 crates of eggs. On Tuesday she sells 2 times as many crates of eggs as Monday. On Wednesday she sells 2 fewer crates than Tuesday. On Thursday she sells half as many crates of eggs as she sells on Tuesday. How many total crates of eggs does she sell for the 4 days?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday she sells 5 crates of eggs.\nOn Tuesday she sells 2*5 crates of eggs, so she sells 2*5 = 10 crates of eggs.\nOn Wednesday she sells 10 crates of eggs - 2 crates less than Tuesday, so she sells 10 - 2 = 8 crates of eggs.\nOn Thursday she sells 1/2*10 crates of eggs (the amount she sells on Tuesday), so she sells 1/2*10 = 5 crates of eggs.\nAdd the number of crates she sells on each day: 5+10+8+5 = 28 crates of eggs in total she sells for those 4 days.\nThat\u2019s how much she\u2019s going to sell in a week\n#### 28\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.515054687857628, "len_probs": 204, "answer": "\nOn Monday she sells 5 crates of eggs.\nOn Tuesday she sells 2*5 crates of eggs, so she sells 2*5 = 10 crates of eggs.\nOn Wednesday she sells 10 crates of eggs - 2 crates less than Tuesday, so she sells 10 - 2 = 8 crates of eggs.\nOn Thursday she sells 1/2*10 crates of eggs (the amount she sells on Tuesday), so she sells 1/2*10 = 5 crates of eggs.\nAdd the number of crates she sells on each day: 5+10+8+5 = 28 crates of eggs in total she sells for those 4 days.\nThat\u2019s how much she\u2019s going to sell in a week\n#### 28\n"}]}
