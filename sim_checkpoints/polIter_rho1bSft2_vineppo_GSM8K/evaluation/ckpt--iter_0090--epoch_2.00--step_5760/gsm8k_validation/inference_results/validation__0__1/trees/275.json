A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nSo the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models in total for the kindergarten and elementary libraries.\nThe original price of each dinosaur was $100.\nThere was a 5% reduction in price for each model, so 100 - (5/100)*100 = 95 dollars.\nThe school bought 6 models, so it paid 6 * 95 = 570 dollars.\n#### 570\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.174312300980091, "len_probs": 139, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nSo the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models in total for the kindergarten and elementary libraries.\nThe original price of each dinosaur was $100.\nThere was a 5% reduction in price for each model, so 100 - (5/100)*100 = 95 dollars.\nThe school bought 6 models, so it paid 6 * 95 = 570 dollars.\n#### 570\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 models (the kindergarten and the two elementary libraries).\nThe original price for each model was $100.\nThere was a 5% reduction in price for each model because 100 * 0.05 = 5\nSo the reduced price for each model was $100 - 5 = $95.\nSo the school paid a total of $95 * 6 = $570.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
