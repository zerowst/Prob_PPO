construct three buildings, with the second building being two times as tall as the first building. The third building had to be three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings. If the first building was 600 feet, calculate the total height of the three buildings together.\n\nSolution:\nThe second building is two times as tall as the first building, so it is 2 * 600 = 1200 feet tall.\nThe combined height of the first and second buildings is 600 + 1200 = 1800 feet.\nThe third building is three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings, so it is 3 * 1800 = 5400 feet tall.\nAltogether, the three buildings are 600 + 1200 + 5400 = 7200 feet in height.\nThat\u2019s how tall the buildings are together.\nThat\u2019s how tall the buildings are
