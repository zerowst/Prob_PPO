The 5 players, including Jess, play 5 rounds in which each player removes one block. In the sixth round, Jess's father goes first. He removes a block, causing the tower to almost fall. Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. How many blocks did the tower have before Jess's turn?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is 5 rounds * 1 block removed per player = 5 blocks.\nIn the first 5 rounds, the tower's total number of blocks is 5 blocks removed from the total of N blocks.\nAfter Jess's father's turn in the 6th round, the tower had left (N-5) blocks.\nSince in the 6th round Jess removed another block, she removed 1 block from the N-5 blocks remaining, so the tower had N = (N-5) + 1 = 6-4+5 = 7 blocks before her turn.\nSo the answer is 7.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.633006241172552, "len_probs": 157, "answer": "\nIn the first 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is 5 rounds * 1 block removed per player = 5 blocks.\nIn the first 5 rounds, the tower's total number of blocks is 5 blocks removed from the total of N blocks.\nAfter Jess's father's turn in the 6th round, the tower had left (N-5) blocks.\nSince in the 6th round Jess removed another block, she removed 1 block from the N-5 blocks remaining, so the tower had N = (N-5) + 1 = 6-4+5 = 7 blocks before her turn.\nSo the answer is 7.\n#### 7\n"}]}
