After how many weeks will the chickens be cheaper than buying his eggs?\n\nSolution:\nRoberto bought the chickens for 4 * $20 = $80.\nThey cost $1 a week to feed. So far, the total cost for feeding them is $0 (since 3 * 1 = 3).\nThey produce 3 eggs a week. So far, the total value of the eggs is $0 (since 0 * 1 = 0).\nHe used to spend $2 per dozen eggs.\nSo, the chickens are $80 / (years of chicken)\nSo, after 1 year the chickens are $80 / (years of chicken)\nSo, after 2 years the chickens are $80 / (years of chicken) < $80\nSo the answer is after 2 years the chickens will be cheaper than his eggs.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.53107738494873, "len_probs": 194, "answer": "\nRoberto bought the chickens for 4 * $20 = $80.\nThey cost $1 a week to feed.
