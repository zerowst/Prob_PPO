If he counts 15 goldfish, how many are below the surface?\n\nSolution:\nSince 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, this means 100% - 25% = 75% of the goldfish are below the surface.\nThese 75% are the ones that Toby counts. He counts 15 goldfish, which 75% of the total amount.\nSo, 100% of the total amount (which is 100%) would be 100 x 15 = 150 goldfish.\nSince Toby's 15 goldfish are 15% of the total, and 100% is 150 goldfish,\nthere could be 100 total goldfish in the pond and\nthat would be the answer to this question: 150 goldfish that are below the surface.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.14031685888767, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nSince 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, this means 100% - 25% = 75% of the goldfish are below the surface.\nThese 75% are the ones that Toby counts.
