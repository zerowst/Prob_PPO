Each cat has a collar decorated with gemstones.  Binkie has four times as many gemstones on his collar as does Frankie but Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does Frankie.  If Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, how many gemstones does Binkie have on his collar?\n\nSolution:\nHalf as many as Spaatz's 1 gemstone is 1/2*1=0.5\nSo Frankie has 4*0.5=2 gemstones on her collar.\nSince Binkie has four times as many as Frankie has, he has 4*2=8 gemstones on his collar.\nSo that\u2019s the answer to the question \u201cHow many is Binkie\u2019s collar holding?\u201d, and it is 8.\nThat is the answer to the question 8\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.888481944799423, "len_probs": 124, "answer": "\nHalf as many as Spaatz's 1 gemstone is 1/2*1=0.5\nSo Frankie has 4*0.5=2 gemstones on her collar.\nSince Binkie has four times as many as Frankie has, he has 4*2=8 gemstones on his collar.\nSo that\u2019s the answer to the question \u201cHow many is Binkie\u2019s collar holding?\u201d, and it is 8.\nThat is the answer to the question 8\n#### 8\n"}, {"text": "\nIf Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, then half as many as Frankie is 1 Gemstone * (1/2) = 1 Gemstone\nIf Frankie has 4 times more Gemstones on her collar than Binkie, then 4 * the number of Gemstones on Binkie\u2019s collar = 1 Gemstone\nSo, Binkie has (4 * the number of Gemstones on Frankie\u2019s collar) * (1/4) = the number of Gemstones\nThis number is 1 Gemstone * (the number of Gemstones on Frankie\u2019s collar) = the number of Gemstones on Frankie\u2019s collar\nSo, Binkie has this number * 4\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nDani has 3 cats; Binkie, Frankie and Spaatz.
