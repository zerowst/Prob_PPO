All told, how much space will these trees take up in his yard?\n\nSolution:\nEach apple tree will be 10 feet wide and will need 12 feet between it, so each apple tree will take 10 + 12 = 22 feet of space.\nSince Quinton is planting 2 apple trees, this means he will have 2 * 22 = 44 feet of apple tree space.\nEach peach tree will be 12 feet wide and will need 15 feet between it, so each peach tree will take 12 + 15 = 27 feet of space.\nSince Quinton is planting 2 peach trees, this means he will have 2 * 27 = 54 feet of peach tree space.\nTogether, the apple trees will be 44 feet of space and the peach trees will be 54 feet of space, so together they will be 44 + 54 = 98 feet of yard space.\nThis is the total space Quinton will have for his fruit trees, so this is the answer to the question \u201chow much space will these trees take up in his yard?\u201d, and it is 98 feet.\n#### 98\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.480953849852085, "len_probs": 256, "answer": "\nEach apple tree will be 10 feet wide and will need 12 feet between it, so each apple tree will take 10 + 12 = 22 feet of space.\nSince Quinton is planting 2 apple trees, this means he will have 2 * 22 = 44 feet of apple tree space.\nEach peach tree will be 12 feet wide and will need 15 feet between it, so each peach tree will take 12 + 15 = 27 feet of space.\nSince Quinton is planting 2 peach trees, this means he will have 2 * 27 = 54 feet of peach tree space.\nTogether, the apple trees will be 44 feet of space and the peach trees will be 54 feet of space, so together they will be 44 + 54 = 98 feet of yard space.\nThis is the total space Quinton will have for his fruit trees, so this is the answer to the question \u201chow much space will these trees take up in his yard?\u201d, and it is 98 feet.\n#### 98\n"}, {"text": "\nFor the apple trees, he needs to account for 2 trees * (10 feet per tree + 12 feet between trees)\nThat means he needs a total of 2 * (10 + 12) feet\nThat needs to be calculated a bit more.\nFor the peach trees, he needs to account for 1 tree * (12 feet per tree + 15 feet between trees)\nThat means he needs a total of 1 * (12 + 15) feet\nThat needs to be calculated a bit more.\nThe apple trees will be 20 feet in total (from the first calculation)\nThe peach trees will be 27 feet in total (from the second calculation)\nSo the apple trees will take up 20 feet of space and the peach trees will take up 27 feet of space.\nSo in total these trees will take up 20 + 27 = 47 feet of space.\n#### 47\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nQuinton is looking to add 4 fruit trees to his backyard.
