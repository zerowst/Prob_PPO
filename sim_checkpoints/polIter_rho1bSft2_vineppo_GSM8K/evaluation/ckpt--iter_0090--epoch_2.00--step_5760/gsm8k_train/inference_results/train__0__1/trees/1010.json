Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?\n\nSolution:\nTwo-thirds of the students at lunch time are outside, so (2/3)*90 = 60 students sat outside.\nOne-third of the students outside ran inside, so 60/3 = 20 students ran in from the outside.\nThis means 60-20 = 40 students were left outside after the 3 students went inside.\nWhile 90-20 (the 3 students) = 70 students were left outside in the first place.\nSo now, 90-20 (the 3 students) -40 (the 20 students who ran in) + the number in the cafeteria =\nSo the final answer is 90-4(20)=30.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.436075016856194, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nTwo-thirds of the students at lunch time are outside, so (2/3)*90 = 60 students sat outside.\nOne-third of the students outside ran inside, so 60/3 = 20 students ran in from the outside.\nThis means 60-20 = 40 students were left outside after the 3 students went inside.\nWhile 90-20 (the 3 students) = 70 students were left outside in the first place.\nSo now, 90-20 (the 3 students) -40 (the 20 students who ran in) + the number in the cafeteria =\nSo the final answer is 90-4(20)=30.\n#### 30\n"}, {"text": "\nTwo-thirds of 90 students is (2/3)*90 = 60 students.\nSo 90-60 = 30 students were left outside in period 5.\nThen 1/3 of those who stayed outside ran inside, so (1/3)*30 = 10\nNow 30-10 = 20 students were inside the cafeteria.\nThere were 20 students in 1/3 of the cafeteria so (1/3)*the whole cafeteria is\n90-3(the other 2/3) = 20\nSo 20 students were in the cafeteria originally and 1/3 went in\nSo 20*3 = 6 students ran inside\n#### 20\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThere are 90 students who have lunch during period 5.
