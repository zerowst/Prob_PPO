Of those, 20% were unfixable, which is 0.2*20 = 4 computers.\n40% of the computers needed to wait for spare parts, which is 0.4*20 = 8 computers.\nThat leaves us with 20 - (4 + 8) = 8 computers that John could fix right away.\nSo, John was able to fix 8 of those computers.\nThat\u2019s how we\u2019ll calculate the number of computers John was able to fix: 8 computers.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the question, as we are told that John was able to fix 8 of the computers.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.742544397711754, "len_probs": 159, "answer": "\nJohn had to fix 20 computers.
