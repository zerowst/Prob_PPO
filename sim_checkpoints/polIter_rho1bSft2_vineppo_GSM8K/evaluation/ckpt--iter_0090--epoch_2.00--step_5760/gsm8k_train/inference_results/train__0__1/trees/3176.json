The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?\n\nSolution:\nThe sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, so they made 57 x 2 = $114 from carrots.\nThe sales of the spinach are 1/2 of the sales of the carrots + $16, so the sales of the spinach are (1/2 x 114) + 16 = $68\nThe total amount of sales from all the other vegetables is the cauliflower sales, so that\u2019s x + 114 + 68\nThe total sales from all the vegetables is $380, so 380 = x + 182\nSubtracting 182 from both sides of the equation gives 380 \u2013 182 = x\nThat\u2019s 198 = x\nThe sales of the cauliflower is $198.\n#### 198\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.040757328271866, "len_probs": 211, "answer": "\nThe sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, so they made 57 x 2 = $114 from carrots.\nThe sales of the spinach are 1/2 of the sales of the carrots + $16, so the sales of the spinach are (1/2 x 114) + 16 = $68\nThe total amount of sales from all the other vegetables is the cauliflower sales, so that\u2019s x + 114 + 68\nThe total sales from all the vegetables is $380, so 380 = x + 182\nSubtracting 182 from both sides of the equation gives 380 \u2013 182 = x\nThat\u2019s 198 = x\nThe sales of the cauliflower is $198.\n#### 198\n"}, {"text": "\nThe sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli, so 2 * $57 = $114.\nHalf of the sales of the carrots is 1/2 * $114 = $57.\nSo, the sales of the spinach were $16 + $57 = $73.\nThe sales of the spinach were not enough to cover the total earnings, so the cauliflower sales were not enough to cover the total earnings, and the total earnings were spent in a total of $380.\nSo, $380 - $350 (from the other things) = $30 was the total earnings from the cauliflower sales.\n#### 30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMaya's organization hosted a weekly farmers' market to raise money for the church choir.
