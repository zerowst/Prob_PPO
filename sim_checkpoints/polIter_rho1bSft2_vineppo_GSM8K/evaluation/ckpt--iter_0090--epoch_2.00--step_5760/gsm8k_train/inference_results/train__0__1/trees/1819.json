A shirt costs $7.50, a pair of pants cost $15, and socks cost $4.50 each if each team member buys the uniform items on their own. If they buy the items as a group, they are given a discount. A discounted shirt cost $6.75, a discounted pair of pants cost $13.50, and discounted socks cost $3.75. How much would their team of 12 save with the group discount?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for one uniform without discount is: $7.50 for the shirt + $15 for the pants + $4.50 for the socks = $27.\nThe total cost for the discounted uniform is: $6.75 for the shirt + $13.50 for the pants + $3.75 for the socks = $23.\nThe difference is $27 - $23 = $4.\nSo, if the team buys the discounted uniforms, they would save $4 per uniform, and since there are 12 team members, that total savings would be $4 * 12 = $48.\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.716819617897272, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nThe total cost for one uniform without discount is: $7.50 for the shirt + $15 for the pants + $4.50 for the socks = $27.\nThe total cost for the discounted uniform is: $6.75 for the shirt + $13.50 for the pants + $3.75 for the socks = $23.\nThe difference is $27 - $23 = $4.\nSo, if the team buys the discounted uniforms, they would save $4 per uniform, and since there are 12 team members, that total savings would be $4 * 12 = $48.\n#### 48\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total cost of a shirt, pants, and socks for each member of the team if they bought individually was:\nShirt: $7.50\nPants: $15\nSocks: $4.50\nSo, $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27\nThe total cost of a shirt, pants, and socks for the team if they bought together was:\nShirt: $6.75\nPants: $13.50\nSocks: $3.75\nSo, $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $23\nThey will save $27 - $23 = $4\nThus, if the team bought the team discounted items, they would save $4.00.\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEach member of Greg\u2019s softball team needs to buy one uniform made up of a shirt, a pair of pants, and socks.
