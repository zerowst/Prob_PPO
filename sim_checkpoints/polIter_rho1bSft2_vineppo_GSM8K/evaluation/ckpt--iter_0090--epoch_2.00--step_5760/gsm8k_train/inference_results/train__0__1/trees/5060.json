spokes.\nSo the total number of spokes the bicycle has is 20 spokes (front) + 40 spokes (back) = 60.\nThe bicycle's wheels have a total of 60 spokes.\nTherefore the answer is 60.\nThis is because the bicycle has two wheels, one with 20 spokes on the front and another with 40 spokes on the back.\nThis is a problem that can be solved by addition.\nAnother way to solve it is:\nThe back wheel has 2 * the spokes of the front wheel, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 spokes.\nAdd the spokes of the front and back wheels together: 40 spokes (back) + 20 spokes (front) = 60 spokes.\nThis is because the 40 spokes on
