Hank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Hank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Then he makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. How much money does Hank donate in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the carwash, Hank makes $100 and donates 90% of these proceeds, so he donates 0.9 * $100 = $90 to the local homeless shelter.\nIn the bake sale, Hank makes $80 and donates 75% of these proceeds, so he donates 0.75 * $80 = $60 to the local homeless shelter.\nIn the lawn mowing, Hank makes $50 and donates 100% of these proceeds, so he donates $50 to the local homeless shelter.\nIn total, Hank donates $90 + $60 + $50 = $200.\nThat means that Hank\u2019s total donation is $200, so that\u2019s it!\nThis is the final answer, the donation is $200.\nThis is a great question for the following reasons:\n1.
