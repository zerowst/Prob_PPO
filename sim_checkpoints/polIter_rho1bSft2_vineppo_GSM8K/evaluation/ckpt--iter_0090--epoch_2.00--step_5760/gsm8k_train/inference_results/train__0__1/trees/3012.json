The question uses a variable to represent the number of claims Jan can handle, and then states that Jan can handle 20 plus a certain percentage more. So the 20 is a base number, and the percentage more is represented by the variable. So if you take the percentage of 30%, it represents a certain number of additional claims. So Missy can handle 26+15=41 claims.\nSo the answer is Missy can handle a 41 claims in total, so she can.\n#### 41\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -48.33547630533576, "len_probs": 266, "answer": "\nJan can handle 20 claims\nJohn can handle 30/100*20=6 more claims\nSo John can handle 20+6=26 claims.\nMissy can handle 15 more claims than John, so Missy can handle 26+15=41 claims.\nThe answer is Missy can handle a 41 claims in total, so she can.\nAnswer: Missy can handle 41 claims.\nThis is a good question and a good example of how to use the information in the problem.
