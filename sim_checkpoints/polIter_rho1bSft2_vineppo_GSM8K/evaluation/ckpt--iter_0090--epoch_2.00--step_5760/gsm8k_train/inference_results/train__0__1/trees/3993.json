How many hours will she need to study before she is ready for the test?\n\nSolution:\nShe has to learn 30 questions for multiple choice, which takes 15 minutes per question * (30 questions) = 450 minutes.\nShe has to learn 30 questions for fill in the blank, which takes 25 minutes per question * (30 questions) = 750 minutes.\nSo she has to study 450 + 750 = 1200 minutes of lesson.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so she has to study 1200 minutes / (60 minutes/hour) = 20 hours of lesson.\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.13953174650669, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nShe has to learn 30 questions for multiple choice, which takes 15 minutes per question * (30 questions) = 450 minutes.\nShe has to learn 30 questions for fill in the blank, which takes 25 minutes per question * (30 questions) = 750 minutes.\nSo she has to study 450 + 750 = 1200 minutes of lesson.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so she has to study 1200 minutes / (60 minutes/hour) = 20 hours of lesson.\n#### 20\n"}, {"text": "\nShe has to learn 30 multiple-choice questions for which she will spend 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.\nShe has to learn 30 fill-in-the-blank questions for which she will spend 25 x 30 = 750 minutes.\nSo, she will spend a total of 450 + 750 = 1200 minutes to study for the test.\nTherefore, 1200 minutes is equal to (1200 / 60) hours\nSo, she will need to study for 2 hours.\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMartiza is studying for the citizenship test.
