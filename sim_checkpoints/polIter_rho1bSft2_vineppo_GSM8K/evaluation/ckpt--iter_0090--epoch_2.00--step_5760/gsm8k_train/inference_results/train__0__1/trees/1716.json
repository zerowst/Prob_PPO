Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount of students who paid the full amount is 25 - 4 = 21 students.\nSo, the total amount of these 21 students' contribution is 21 * $50 = $1050.\nThe other 4 students paid only $50 / 2 = $25 each.\nSo, the total amount of these 4 students' contribution is 4 * $25 = $100.\nHence, the class was able to gather $1,150 (1050 + 100).\nTo sum up, the class was able to gather $1,150 (as a result of the 21 students' contribution and the 4 students' contribution).\n#### 1,150\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.428411312401295, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nThe total amount of students who paid the full amount is 25 - 4 = 21 students.\nSo, the total amount of these 21 students' contribution is 21 * $50 = $1050.\nThe other 4 students paid only $50 / 2 = $25 each.\nSo, the total amount of these 4 students' contribution is 4 * $25 = $100.\nHence, the class was able to gather $1,150 (1050 + 100).\nTo sum up, the class was able to gather $1,150 (as a result of the 21 students' contribution and the 4 students' contribution).\n#### 1,150\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total number of students who paid the full amount was 25 students - 4 students = 21 students.\nSo, the amount they each paid was $50.\nTherefore, the total amount they paid was 21 students * $50 = $1050.\nThe number of students who paid half was 4 students.\nSo, the amount they each paid was half of $50, which is $50/2 = $25.\nTherefore, the total amount those 4 students paid was 4 students * $25 = $100.\nSo, the class was able to gather 21 students (who paid full amount) + 0 (who paid half amount) + 4 students (who paid half amount)\n= $21 (or $100 for the 4 who paid half)\nAdd that with the 4 students who paid half and you get $100 + $1050 (the amount they got from full payment) = $1150.\n#### 1150\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIn Mary's class, there are 25 students.
