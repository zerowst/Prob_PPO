If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  Each bedroom has 2 people, and each bathroom has 2 people.  Each kitchen has 4 people.\nThus, each cylindrical structure has 12 * 2 + 7 * 2 + (number of kitchens) * 4\nThere are 3 such cylindrical structures, so they have a total of 3 * (12 * 2 + 7 * 2 + (number of kitchens) * 4)\nThe entire space station has 72 rooms, so 3 * (12 * 2 + 7 * 2 + (number of kitchens) * 4) = 72\nSolving, we get 24 + 42 + (number of kitchens) * 4 = 72\n(number of kitchens) * 4 = 72 - 24 - 42\n(number of kitchens) * 4 = 8\n(number of kitchens) = 2.\nThere are 2 kitchens on the entire space station.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.672894954681396, "len_probs": 267, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.
