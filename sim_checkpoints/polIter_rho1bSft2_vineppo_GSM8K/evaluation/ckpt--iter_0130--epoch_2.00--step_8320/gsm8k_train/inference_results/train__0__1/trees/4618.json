He wants to know which is the better value, so instead of just looking at the overall price, he looks at the price per ounce. The larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces. The larger box costs $4.80. The smaller box costs $3.40. What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?\n\nSolution:\nThe larger box costs $4.80\nThere is a total of 30 * cost per ounce\nThe smaller box costs $3.40\nThere is a total of 20 * cost per ounce\nThe second total is $12 less than the first total\nSo each ounce in the second total is $0.4\nThere is a total of 3\nSo the cost per ounce is 3* $0.4\nSo the answer is $1.2\n#### 120\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.419795233756304, "len_probs": 115, "answer": "\nThe larger box costs $4.80\nThere is a total of 30 * cost per ounce\nThe smaller box costs $3.40\nThere is a total of 20 * cost per ounce\nThe second total is $12 less than the first total\nSo each ounce in the second total is $0.4\nThere is a total of 3\nSo the cost per ounce is 3* $0.4\nSo the answer is $1.2\n#### 120\n"}, {"text": "\nThe larger box costs $4.80\nThe smaller box costs $3.40\nThe difference in cost is $4.80 - $3.40 = $1.40.\nThe larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces.\nThe smaller box is smaller so it is cheaper per ounce because 20 is less than 30.\nThe smaller box is $1.40 less than the larger box which contained 3 more ounces at $1.40 each so those 3 ounces would have cost $1.40 / 3 = $4.60\nSo the answer is $4.60 is the better value because it is less $1.40\nSo the answer is: The price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)= $1.40\n#### 140\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nOliver is trying to decide between two different sized boxes of macaroni and cheese.
