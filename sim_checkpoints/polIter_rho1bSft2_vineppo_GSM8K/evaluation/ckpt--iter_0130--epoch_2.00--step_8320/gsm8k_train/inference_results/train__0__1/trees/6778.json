If he spends $1,200 on the flight, $800 on a hotel, and $3,000 on food, how much money, in dollars, does he have left?\n\nSolution:\nThe total expenses for Joe are $1,200 + $800 + $3,000 = $5,000.\nJoe's savings was $6,000.\nJoe has $6,000 - $5,000 = $1,000 left.\nTherefore, he left $1,000 after paying for the flight, hotel, and food. Renting a car is a different story.\nIt could be that the $1,000 is not enough for Joe\u2019s car rental.\nWe can say this with certainty because $1,000 is less than $4,000, the maximum amount for which Joe's car insurance will cover Joe's car during the entire trip.\nJoe's car insurance will not cover the $4,000 - $1,000 = $3,000 left over for the car.\nJoe has $1,000 left after paying for the car's rent.\n#### 1,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -52.85946423560381, "len_probs": 248, "answer": "\nThe total expenses for Joe are $1,200 + $800 + $3,000 = $5,000.\nJoe's savings was $6,000.\nJoe has $6,000 - $5,000 = $1,000 left.\nTherefore, he left $1,000 after paying for the flight, hotel, and food.
