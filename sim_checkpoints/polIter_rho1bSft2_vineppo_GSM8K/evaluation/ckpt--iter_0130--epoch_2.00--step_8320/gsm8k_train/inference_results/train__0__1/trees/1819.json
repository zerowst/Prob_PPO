A shirt costs $7.50, a pair of pants cost $15, and socks cost $4.50 each if each team member buys the uniform items on their own. If they buy the items as a group, they are given a discount. A discounted shirt cost $6.75, a discounted pair of pants cost $13.50, and discounted socks cost $3.75. How much would their team of 12 save with the group discount?\n\nSolution:\nThe original total cost for each uniform item is: $7.50 for the shirt + $15 for pants + $4.50 for socks\nSo the total cost for 1 shirt, 1 pair of pants, and 1 pair of socks is: $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27\nIf they buy the items individually, the total cost is: $27 for 1 shirt + $27 for 1 pair of pants + $27 for 1 pair of socks\nThe total cost for the team of 12 is: $27 x 12 = $324\nThe discounted total cost for each uniform item is: $6.75 for the shirt + $13.50 for pants + $3.75 for socks\nSo the total cost for the team with the discount is: $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $25\nIf they buy the items individually, the total cost is: $25 for 1 shirt + $25 for 1 pair of pants + $25 for 1 pair of socks\nThe total cost for the team of 12 is: $25 x 12 = $300\nThey would save $300 - $324 = $26 with the group discount.\n#### 26\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.774666249752045, "len_probs": 325, "answer": "\nThe original total cost for each uniform item is: $7.50 for the shirt + $15 for pants + $4.50 for socks\nSo the total cost for 1 shirt, 1 pair of pants, and 1 pair of socks is: $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27\nIf they buy the items individually, the total cost is: $27 for 1 shirt + $27 for 1 pair of pants + $27 for 1 pair of socks\nThe total cost for the team of 12 is: $27 x 12 = $324\nThe discounted total cost for each uniform item is: $6.75 for the shirt + $13.50 for pants + $3.75 for socks\nSo the total cost for the team with the discount is: $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $25\nIf they buy the items individually, the total cost is: $25 for 1 shirt + $25 for 1 pair of pants + $25 for 1 pair of socks\nThe total cost for the team of 12 is: $25 x 12 = $300\nThey would save $300 - $324 = $26 with the group discount.\n#### 26\n"}, {"text": "\nThe original total cost for each team member to buy the items individually was:\nShirt: $7.50\nPants: $15\nSocks: $4.50 each\nSo for one team member, the total cost was: $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27\nThe team members together have a total of: 12 x $27 = $324\nIf the group gets the discount, the total cost for each team member with the discount is:\nShirt: $6.75\nPants: $13.50\nSocks: $3.75 each\nSo for one team member, the total cost with discount is: $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $23\nThe team members together have a total of: 12 x $23 = $276\nThe team would save $324 - 276 = $48 if they all got the discount.\n#### 48\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEach member of Greg\u2019s softball team needs to buy one uniform made up of a shirt, a pair of pants, and socks.
