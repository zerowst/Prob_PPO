Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?\n\nSolution:\nBess throws a Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters = 80 meters.\nShe then throws it back 4 times * 1 time she throws it back\nSo she throws it a total of\n80 + (4*1) = 88 meters\nHolly throws a Frisbee 5 times * 8 meters = 40 meters.\nShe leaves them both\nSo in total, she throws 40 + her 4\nSo the answer is 40 + 4 = 44 meters\n#### 44\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.026650931686163, "len_probs": 126, "answer": "\nBess throws a Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters = 80 meters.\nShe then throws it back 4 times * 1 time she throws it back\nSo she throws it a total of\n80 + (4*1) = 88 meters\nHolly throws a Frisbee 5 times * 8 meters = 40 meters.\nShe leaves them both\nSo in total, she throws 40 + her 4\nSo the answer is 40 + 4 = 44 meters\n#### 44\n"}, {"text": "\nBess throws and catches her Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters = 80 meters of distance.\nShe throws and catches this Frisbee back to her original position 5 times *\n(80 meters of distance + 8 meters of distance to her original position\nsince she throws it back after each throw and that distance is\nhalf the distance of the throw because it takes two hands to\nthrow it back)\n= 400\n#### 400\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park.
