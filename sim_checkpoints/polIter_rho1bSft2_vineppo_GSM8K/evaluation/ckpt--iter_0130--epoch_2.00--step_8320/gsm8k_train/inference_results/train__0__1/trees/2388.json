He buys 6 2$ cans of soup, 2 $5 loaves of bread, 2 3$ boxes of cereal, and 2 $4 gallons of milk.  When he gets to the register, he opens his wallet to pay and realizes he only has $10 bills in there.  How many $10 bills does he need to use to pay?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the soup is 6 * $2 = $12.\nThe total cost of the bread is 2 * $5 = $10.\nThe total cost of the cereal is 2 * $3 +\nsince each box costs $3\n= $6 + $6 = $12.\nThe total cost of the milk is $4 x 2 = $8.\nSo the total amount Mark spent was $12 + $10 + $6 + $8 = $36.\nTherefore, Mark has to use $36 / $10 = 3 $10 bills to pay.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.36727510392666, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the soup is 6 * $2 = $12.\nThe total cost of the bread is 2 * $5 = $10.\nThe total cost of the cereal is 2 * $3 +\nsince each box costs $3\n= $6 + $6 = $12.\nThe total cost of the milk is $4 x 2 = $8.\nSo the total amount Mark spent was $12 + $10 + $6 + $8 = $36.\nTherefore, Mark has to use $36 / $10 = 3 $10 bills to pay.\n#### 3\n"}, {"text": "\nThe soup cost 6*2=$12.\nThe bread cost 2*5=$10.\nThe cereal cost 2*3=$6.\nThe milk cost 2*4=$8.\nSo the total cost is $12+ $10 +$6 + $8 = $36.\nHe needs 36/10 $10 bills because he has to have a whole number of bills when paying.\nHe needs to use 3 $10 bills + (bunch of bills)\nHe could also use 4 $10 bills +\nHe could also use 5 $10 bills +\nThat's $5 more than he could use.\n#### 3\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark goes into the store to buy some groceries.
