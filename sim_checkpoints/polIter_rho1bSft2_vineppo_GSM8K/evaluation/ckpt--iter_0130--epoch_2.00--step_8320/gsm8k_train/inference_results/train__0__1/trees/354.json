The dress's hem is 3 feet long. Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long. If Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute, how many minutes does it take Jenna to hem her dress?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how long the dress is in total by dividing the length in feet by the length per foot: 3 feet / 12 inches per foot\nThat gives you a total length of 3 feet / (12 inches/foot) = 0.25\nSo the hem is 0.25 feet long.\nThen figure out how many inches make up that length by multiplying by the length per inch:\n0.25 feet x (length not per foot)\nThat gives you (length not per foot) x 12\nSo the hem is 3 x (length not per foot)\nThen:\n(length not per foot) = 3 / (length per inch)\n(length not per foot) = 3 / (length per inch)\n(length not per foot) = 3 / (length per inch)\nlength not per inch = 3 / (length per inch)\nlength not per inch = 3 / (length per inch)\nlength not per inch = 0.25\nSo the dress is 0.25 feet long.\nThen figure out how many stitches Jenna makes per minute by dividing the number of inches per stitch Jenna has by the length per inch of her stitch: 1/4 inch / 12 inches per inch = 0.25 stitch/inch\nThen divide the total number of inches of hem by the number of inches per stitch to find the number of stitches Jenna needs to make: 0.25 feet / (1/4 inch/stitch)\n= 0.25 x 4\n= 1 stitch\nSo Jenna needs to make 1 stitch/minute\nThat means it takes Jenna 1 / 1 stitch/minute = 1 minute\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -56.58060599863529, "len_probs": 413, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how long the dress is in total by dividing the length in feet by the length per foot: 3 feet / 12 inches per foot\nThat gives you a total length of 3 feet / (12 inches/foot) = 0.25\nSo the hem is 0.25 feet long.\nThen figure out how many inches make up that length by multiplying by the length per inch:\n0.25 feet x (length not per foot)\nThat gives you (length not per foot) x 12\nSo the hem is 3 x (length not per foot)\nThen:\n(length not per foot) = 3 / (length per inch)\n(length not per foot) = 3 / (length per inch)\n(length not per foot) = 3 / (length per inch)\nlength not per inch = 3 / (length per inch)\nlength not per inch = 3 / (length per inch)\nlength not per inch = 0.25\nSo the dress is 0.25 feet long.\nThen figure out how many stitches Jenna makes per minute by dividing the number of inches per stitch Jenna has by the length per inch of her stitch: 1/4 inch / 12 inches per inch = 0.25 stitch/inch\nThen divide the total number of inches of hem by the number of inches per stitch to find the number of stitches Jenna needs to make: 0.25 feet / (1/4 inch/stitch)\n= 0.25 x 4\n= 1 stitch\nSo Jenna needs to make 1 stitch/minute\nThat means it takes Jenna 1 / 1 stitch/minute = 1 minute\n#### 1\n"}]}
