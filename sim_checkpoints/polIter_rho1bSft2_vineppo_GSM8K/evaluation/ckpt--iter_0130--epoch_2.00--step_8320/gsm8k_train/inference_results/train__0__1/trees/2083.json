He orders a steak and egg meal for $16.  He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the meal was $16 (steak) + $14 (chicken fried steak) = $30.\nHis friend paid $14 and James paid $16\nSo the total cost for the meal for James and his friend\nSo James paid: $30\nSo the total cost for James and his friend's meal\nSo James paid: $18\nSo the tip James should pay: 20% of $18 = $3.6\nSo James paid $3 + the tip = $3 + $3.6 = $6.6\n#### 6.6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.041038796305656, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the meal was $16 (steak) + $14 (chicken fried steak) = $30.\nHis friend paid $14 and James paid $16\nSo the total cost for the meal for James and his friend\nSo James paid: $30\nSo the total cost for James and his friend's meal\nSo James paid: $18\nSo the tip James should pay: 20% of $18 = $3.6\nSo James paid $3 + the tip = $3 + $3.6 = $6.6\n#### 6.6\n"}]}
