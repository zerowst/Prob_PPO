How many cats does the shelter have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe shelter originally had 12 / 2 = 6 cats.\nThey had a total of 12\nAfter 2 days, 3\nThen, 1\nSo now they have a total of 12 + 3 (made in 2)\n= 15 cats (\nThey have 6 + 3 = 9 original cats\nbecause they had 5 total kittens\nbecause they had one more cat after 2 days\nafter the 2\nSo 15\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -52.297922890633345, "len_probs": 119, "answer": "\nThe shelter originally had 12 / 2 = 6 cats.\nThey had a total of 12\nAfter 2 days, 3\nThen, 1\nSo now they have a total of 12 + 3 (made in 2)\n= 15 cats (\nThey have 6 + 3 = 9 original cats\nbecause they had 5 total kittens\nbecause they had one more cat after 2 days\nafter the 2\nSo 15\n#### 15\n"}]}
