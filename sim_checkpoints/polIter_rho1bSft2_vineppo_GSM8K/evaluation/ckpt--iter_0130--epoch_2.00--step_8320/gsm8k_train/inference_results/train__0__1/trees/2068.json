That is the amount it should pay the employee after the intern overcharged them.\n<$20,700\n2010\n\\$20,700\n#### 2010\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -54.854246037080884, "len_probs": 187, "answer": "\nThe total cost for all 150 pieces of furniture is $20,700,\nThe intern had charged Remy an additional 134 * 15 = $2010 for the same reason.\nRemy paid $20,700 + the $2010 that the intern added for overcharge = $22710\nIf Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC reimburses Remy, they will pay $22,710 - $20,700 = $2010\nThat is how much the company wants to pay the employee back.
