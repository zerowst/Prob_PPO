How long, in feet, did the fourth competitor jump?\n\nSolution:\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, or a total distance of 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, or a total distance of 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, or a total distance of 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nThe fourth competitor jumped 24 feet for a distance in the finals.\nThe finals are where the competition is being held, so it makes sense that this would be the answer.\nIf you are not sure, you could always solve the problem in the following way:\nThe first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, so he jumped 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, so he jumped 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, so he jumped 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nThe fourth competitor jumped 24 feet for a distance in the finals.\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.88404317945242, "len_probs": 300, "answer": "\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, or a total distance of 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, or a total distance of 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, or a total distance of 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nThe fourth competitor jumped 24 feet for a distance in the finals.\nThe finals are where the competition is being held, so it makes sense that this would be the answer.\nIf you are not sure, you could always solve the problem in the following way:\nThe first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, so he jumped 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, so he jumped 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, so he jumped 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nThe fourth competitor jumped 24 feet for a distance in the finals.\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nThe second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, or a total distance of 22 + 1 = 23 feet.\nThe third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, or a total distance of 23 - 2 = 21 feet.\nAnd the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, or a total distance of 21 + 3 = 24 feet.\nThe fourth competitor jumped 24 feet for a distance.
