How many liters of water altogether are contained within the bottles in the boxes?\n\nSolution:\nEach box contains 50 x 10 = 500 bottles of water.\nEach bottle has a capacity of 12 liters.\nEach bottle has a capacity of 12 x 3/4 = 9 liters of water filled up.\nSo, there a total of 500 x 9 = 4500 liters of water in the bottles in the boxes.\nThat\u2019s a total of 4500 liters of water is more than what we were asked to find.\nTherefore, there are more than 45\nYou should see this in a different way.\nOr let me see if I can explain it in a different way.\nThis is a problem about the volume of water in a container and how it can be measured in different units.\nThe volume of water in the bottles in the boxes is 4500 liters of water.\nThat\u2019s a lot of water.\nIt\u2019s a lot of water that you can fill up all the 500 bottles of the boxes.\nSo, the answer is this is a lot of water that you can do a lot of things with it.\nIt is a lot of water. It is not a lot of water if you don\u2019t have the capacity to do the things with it.\nSo that\u2019s the question.
