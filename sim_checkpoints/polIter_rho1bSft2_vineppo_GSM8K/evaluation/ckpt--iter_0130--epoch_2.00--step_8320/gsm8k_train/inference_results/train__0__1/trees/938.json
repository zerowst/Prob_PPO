If they reduced the total production by 10 percent in the second year, calculate the total production of television by the factory in the second year.\n\nSolution:\nIn the first year, the factory produced 10 televisions per day for a total of 365 days (as there is no time\nlost in calculating days per year in a leap year, as we did in the previous example).\nSo, in the first year, the total production was:\nTelevision production in first year = 10 TVs/day * 365 days = 3650 TVs.\n\nIn the second year, they reduced the total production by 10 percent.
