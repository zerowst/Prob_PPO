If there are four rows with six desks each that are all 2/3 full, how many students does Carla teach, including the ones in and out of the classroom?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total number of desks in the classroom: 4 rows * 6 desks/row = 24 desks.\nThen find the total number of students in the classroom that are 2/3 full: 24 desks * 2/3 = 16 students.\nNext find the total number of students that are absent. The number of students that are absent is three times the number of students that are in the restroom, or 3 * the number of students in the restroom.\nThe total number of students in the classroom is therefore, 16 students (in-class) - (less than 1/3 of that number)\nThat missing number is 1\nSo the total number of students Carla teaches is 16+1= 17 students.\n#### 17\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.85986356437206, "len_probs": 184, "answer": "\nFirst find the total number of desks in the classroom: 4 rows * 6 desks/row = 24 desks.\nThen find the total number of students in the classroom that are 2/3 full: 24 desks * 2/3 = 16 students.\nNext find the total number of students that are absent.
