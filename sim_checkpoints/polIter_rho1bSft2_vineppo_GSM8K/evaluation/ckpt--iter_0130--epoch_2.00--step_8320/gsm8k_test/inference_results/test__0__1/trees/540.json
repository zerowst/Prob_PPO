The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe eldest originally paid a total of $18 - $5 (his share increased by $5 after his eldest added) = $11\nThe eldest then added another $10 on the second day, so he had a total $1 + $5 + $10 = another $16\nAfter spending $8, he was left with $16 - $8 = $8\nHe then saved $8 x 3 = $24\nAfter spending some money, he was left with the original $8 + the $24 = $32\n#### 32\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.04028094187379, "len_probs": 130, "answer": "\nThe eldest originally paid a total of $18 - $5 (his share increased by $5 after his eldest added) = $11\nThe eldest then added another $10 on the second day, so he had a total $1 + $5 + $10 = another $16\nAfter spending $8, he was left with $16 - $8 = $8\nHe then saved $8 x 3 = $24\nAfter spending some money, he was left with the original $8 + the $24 = $32\n#### 32\n"}]}
