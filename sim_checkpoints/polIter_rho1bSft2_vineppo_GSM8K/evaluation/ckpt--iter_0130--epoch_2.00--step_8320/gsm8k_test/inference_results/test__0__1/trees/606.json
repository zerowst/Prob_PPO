If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire needs to be replaced?\n\nSolution:\nJeremy drives 400 miles a month so over 12 months, he drives 400*12 = 4800 miles.\nEvery 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times. So the car needs to rotate 4800/2= 2400 tires.\nEach tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. So the car needs to rotate 2400*10,440,000 = 258,880,000\nEach year, there is one 365-day month in 52 weeks\nSo there are 258,880,000/1,269,999,999.97\nThere are 19\nSo the answer is 19 years before the tire needs to be replaced.\n#### 19\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.40277497470379, "len_probs": 215, "answer": "\nJeremy drives 400 miles a month so over 12 months, he drives 400*12 = 4800 miles.\nEvery 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times.
