third of the total number of Pomeranian puppies, then the total number of all the puppies is 6 * 3 = 18.\nIf 2/3 of all the puppies are Pomeranians, then the total number of all Jana's puppies is 18 / (2/3) = 27.\n#### The answer is 27.\n#### Jana has 27 puppies in her.\n########\n#### 27\n########\n#### (Another way to solve this problem is:\nIf x/3 are the total number of puppies in the group and we know that x/3 is equal to 2\nwe can say: 2 = 3x\nthus: x = 2/3\n#### 27\n#### 6\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n#### (\n####
