When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?\n\nSolution:\nThe factory used to make 10 tractors = 10 * $100 = $1000\nThey used to make 5 silos a day = 5 * $220 = $1100\nNow they make more money per day\n$1000\n$1100\nThey are making $1100 - $1000 = 100 more a day\nThe percentage more they are making per day = 100 / 1000 * 100\n= 10% more per day.\nThe amount they are making more is in a fraction so it will be a positive value\nSo the answer is 10%\nAlternatively, a number added to another number is added by the amount the second number minus the first number.
