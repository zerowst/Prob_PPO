He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first test, Mark took 5 x 8 = 40 questions because there was a time for every number of minutes.\nOn the second test, Mark took 5 x 6 = 30 questions because there was a time for every number of minutes.\nThus he completed a total of\n40 + 30 = 70 questions.\nHe took 75; therefore, he has\n75 - 70 = 5 questions left to learn.\nTherefore he has to leave 5 questions incomplete, hence the answer is 5. (There's a rule that says you should never say you are not hungry because you are not hungry; this is an example of a non-sequitur.)\n#### 5\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -43.477473229169846, "len_probs": 166, "answer": "\nOn the first test, Mark took 5 x 8 = 40 questions because there was a time for every number of minutes.\nOn the second test, Mark took 5 x 6 = 30 questions because there was a time for every number of minutes.\nThus he completed a total of\n40 + 30 = 70 questions.\nHe took 75; therefore, he has\n75 - 70 = 5 questions left to learn.\nTherefore he has to leave 5 questions incomplete, hence the answer is 5.
