If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?\n\nSolution:\nThe DIY saves 20% from the original cost of $400, which is (20/100)*$400 = $80.\nThe DIY cost is $400 - $80 = $320.\nThus, the DIYed wallpaper cost is $320 after Ethan made it.\nThus, $320\nAre you sure? You can also use the equation:\nTotal cost is the amount Ethan spent, $320.\nSo the answer is $320.\nOr $320 is the final amount.\nIt's always the same answer.
