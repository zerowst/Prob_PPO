She has 6 yams which can be sold at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. If she sells everything, how much will she earn?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount from selling yams is 6 x $1.5 = $9.\nThe total amount from selling sweet potatoes is 10 x $2 = $20.\nThe total amount from selling carrots is 4 x $1.25 = $5.\nSo the total amount from all these is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.\nHence, Jen will earn $34 if she sells all these items.\nThe amount is a whole number because it's a part of a whole transaction. So Jen earns whole dollars.\n$34 is the correct answer.\nIf there is a mistake, you can always round up or down.\nIt's better to round up in this case.\nSo Jen will earn $34 if rounded up to the nearest whole number.\n#### 34\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -62.212921384721994, "len_probs": 194, "answer": "\nThe total amount from selling yams is 6 x $1.5 = $9.\nThe total amount from selling sweet potatoes is 10 x $2 = $20.\nThe total amount from selling carrots is 4 x $1.25 = $5.\nSo the total amount from all these is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.\nHence, Jen will earn $34 if she sells all these items.\nThe amount is a whole number because it's a part of a whole transaction.
