Red balls cost $9, Blue balls cost $5 and green balls cost $3. How much will the store have received after all the balls are sold?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for the red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.\nThe total cost for the blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.\nAnd the total cost for the green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.\nSo, the total amount the store will receive after selling all these balls is $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.\nHence, the store will receive a total amount of $157 after all. The following is a table showing the distribution of each color of ball.\n\n| Number of Balls | Number of Red Balls | Number of Blue Balls | Number of Green Balls |\n|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 3                 | 0                   | 0                   | 0                   |\n| 11                 | 0                   | 0                   | 0                   |\n| 25                 | 0                   | 0                   | 0                   |\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Total Red Balls    | 3 x $9 = $27      |                    |                    |\n| Total Blue Balls   | 11 x $5 = $55        |                    |                    |\n| Total Green Balls   | 25 x $3 = $75        |                    |                    |\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Total Amount Received | $27 + $55 + $75 = $157\n#### 157\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.970676202327013, "len_probs": 369, "answer": "\nThe total cost for the red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.\nThe total cost for the blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.\nAnd the total cost for the green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.\nSo, the total amount the store will receive after selling all these balls is $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.\nHence, the store will receive a total amount of $157 after all.
