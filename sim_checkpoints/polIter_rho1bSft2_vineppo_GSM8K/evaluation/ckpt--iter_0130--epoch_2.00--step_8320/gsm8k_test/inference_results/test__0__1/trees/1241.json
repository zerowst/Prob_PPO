She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?\n\nSolution:\nFive dozens of eggs are equal to 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.\nSo, Rose bought these 60 eggs at $2.40 each for a total expense of 60 x $2.40 = $144.\nShe sells these 60 eggs at $1 each for a total revenue of 60 x $1 = $60.\nTherefore, Rose's profit is $60 - $144 = - $84.\nHence we can say that there is a loss of $84.\nTherefore, she will lose $84 after this transaction.\n#### 84.\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 84\n</span>\n#### 8\n</span>\n#### 84\n</span>\n#### 8\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n#### 8\n</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$</span>\n#### 8\n#### 8\n#### <span class=\"caret\">$", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -35.46223050355911, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nFive dozens of eggs are equal to 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.\nSo, Rose bought these 60 eggs at $2.40 each for a total expense of 60 x $2.40 = $144.\nShe sells these 60 eggs at $1 each for a total revenue of 60 x $1 = $60.\nTherefore, Rose's profit is $60 -
