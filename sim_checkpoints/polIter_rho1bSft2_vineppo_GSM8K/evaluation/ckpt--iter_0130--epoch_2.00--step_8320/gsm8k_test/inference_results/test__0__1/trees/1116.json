How many students are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class?\n\nSolution:\nAn increase of 20% is an increase of 20/100 * 50 = 10 students.\nThis year there are 50 + 10 = 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nThis year, the 6\nThe number of students in the class is the same as this year because there is no change in the number of students in the class.\nIt is important to note that it is not possible to have \"6\" in this context.\nThere is a mistake in the problem statement. A 20% increase of 50 students is not 10 more than 50; it's an increase of something else.\nIf the 20% increase was meant to be a 20% increase of the 50 students, then it would be a total increase of\n(20/100)*50 = 10 more students.\nThis year there are 50 + 10 = 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -65.35524237900972, "len_probs": 237, "answer": "\nAn increase of 20% is an increase of 20/100 * 50 = 10 students.\nThis year there are 50 + 10 = 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.\nThis year, the 6\nThe number of students in the class is the same as this year because there is no change in the number of students in the class.\nIt is important to note that it is not possible to have \"6\" in this context.\nThere is a mistake in the problem statement.
