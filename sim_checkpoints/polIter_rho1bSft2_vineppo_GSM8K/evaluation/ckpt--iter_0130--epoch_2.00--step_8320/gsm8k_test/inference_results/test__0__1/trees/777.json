How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?\n\nSolution:\nMike has a total collection of 600 movies. If this is broken down into thirds, there are a total of\n600 / 3 = 200 normal movies.\nAnd 40 percent of the 200 movies that are normal are older movies, or 0.4*200 = 80 movies.\nSo the total cost for normal movies is, $10 each, so total cost for normal movies is $10 x 200 = $200.\nAnd the total cost for the older movies is, $5 each, so total cost for the older movies is $5 x 80 = $400.\nSo the total cost for all the movies is $200 + $400 = $600. This means the total cost\ntherefore is $600.\n#### 600\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.09934463724494, "len_probs": 206, "answer": "\nMike has a total collection of 600 movies.
