How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how many large-sized picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day: 5 scenes/day\nThen figure out how many medium-sized picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day: 6 scenes/day\nThen figure out how many small-sized picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day: 7 scenes/day\nNow, add all three types of the scenes together to find the total number of scenes Lauren can draw per day: 5 scenes/day + 6 scenes/day + 7 scenes/day = 18 scenes/day\nNow, divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of scenes Lauren can draw per day to find how many days it take to finish the job: 45 large scenes / 18 scenes/day = 2 days\nNow, divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of scenes Lauren can draw per day to find how many days it take to finish the job: 36 medium scenes / 18 scenes/day = 2 days\nNow, divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of scenes Lauren can draw per day to find how many days it take to finish the job: 49 small scenes / 18 scenes/day = 3 days\nNow add up the days for all three types of scenes to find total days: 2 days + 2 days + 3 days = 7 days.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.934631869196892, "len_probs": 310, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how many large-sized picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day: 5 scenes/day\nThen figure out how many medium-sized picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day: 6 scenes/day\nThen figure out how many small-sized picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day: 7 scenes/day\nNow, add all three types of the scenes together to find the total number of scenes Lauren can draw per day: 5 scenes/day + 6 scenes/day + 7 scenes/day = 18 scenes/day\nNow, divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of scenes Lauren can draw per day to find how many days it take to finish the job: 45 large scenes / 18 scenes/day = 2 days\nNow, divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of scenes Lauren can draw per day to find how many days it take to finish the job: 36 medium scenes / 18 scenes/day = 2 days\nNow, divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of scenes Lauren can draw per day to find how many days it take to finish the job: 49 small scenes / 18 scenes/day = 3 days\nNow add up the days for all three types of scenes to find total days: 2 days + 2 days + 3 days = 7 days.\n#### 7\n"}, {"text": "\nLauren can draw a total of 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.\nShe can create a total of 5 x 0\nShe can create a total of 6 x 0\nShe can create a total of 7 x 0\nThis means she can create this amount of work in 0 days.\nThis is because 45 + 36 + 49 = 120\nShe will never need to work a day for this amount of work.
