The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\nMultiplying by 5.9, the volume is 1400 x 5.9 = 838\nThe pool will hold 838 gallons of water.\nThe cost to fill the pool is 838 x $0.10 = $83.80\nThe cost is $83.80\nTherefore, the final cost is $83.80\nThere are no other options. The answer is in a single number,\nThis is the answer. The final cost is the answer.\nNo need to calculate further.\nThe final amount in $83.80.\n#### 83.80\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -58.492652513086796, "len_probs": 175, "answer": "\nThe volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.\nMultiplying by 5.9, the volume is 1400 x 5.9 = 838\nThe pool will hold 838 gallons of water.\nThe cost to fill the pool is 838 x $0.10 = $83.80\nThe cost is $83.80\nTherefore, the final cost is $83.80\nThere are no other options.
