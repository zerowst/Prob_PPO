How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?\n\nSolution:\nEach sandwich would require 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese for a total of 2 pounds per sandwich.\nThere are 20 people in total watching the game so each pound of meat and cheese will be enough for 4\nThere will be a total of 80 pounds of ingredients to make 20 sandwiches\nIf it takes 1 pounds of meat and 1 pounds of cheese\nIt will take 80 pounds of pork and cheese\nThe pork cost $7.00 per pound so it will cost 80*$7.00 = $560.00 for the pork\nThe cheese cost $3.00 per pound so it will cost 80*$3.00 = $240.00 for the cheese\nAltogether the total cost was $560.00 + $240.00 = $800.00\n#### 800\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.33383923023939, "len_probs": 223, "answer": "\nEach sandwich would require 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese for a total of 2 pounds per sandwich.\nThere are 20 people in total watching the game so each pound of meat and cheese will be enough for 4\nThere will be a total of 80 pounds of ingredients to make 20 sandwiches\nIf it takes 1 pounds of meat and 1 pounds of cheese\nIt will take 80 pounds of pork and cheese\nThe pork cost $7.00 per pound so it will cost 80*$7.00 = $560.00 for the pork\nThe cheese cost $3.00 per pound so it will cost 80*$3.00 = $240.00 for the cheese\nAltogether the total cost was $560.00 + $240.00 = $800.00\n#### 800\n"}, {"text": "\nHe needs to make 20/4=5 sandwiches\nSo he needs 5*pounds=pounds\nThe total cost for meat will be 5*cost per\nhe needs 20\nSo he is going to spend\n$7*5=$35.00 for meat\nHe also needs\n5*3.00=15\nSo the total cost for cheese\nHe needs 20\nSo the total cost for cheese is\n$3*20=$60.00\nThe total is $60+35=$95.00 in total\n#### 95\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.
