Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?\n\nSolution:\nThe drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel, or 4 * 5 = 20 minutes.\nTo get to the theater first, Bernadette must leave after Wayne\u2019s four-minute wait is over, meaning his drive takes at least four minutes.\nThis means Bernadette must leave *after* Wayne's four-minute wait, so any time after that until her drive takes at least 20 minutes.\nLet\u2019s say Bernadette leaves x minutes after Wayne\u2019s four-minute wait.\nIn those x minutes, Bernadette could have:\n-left her car, gone shopping, etc.\nAnd if Bernadette leaves x minutes after Wayne's four-minute wait, and before her own 20-minute wait, then she must leave before x + 20\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.16991801187396, "len_probs": 201, "answer": "\nThe drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel, or 4 * 5 = 20 minutes.\nTo get to the theater first, Bernadette must leave after Wayne\u2019s four-minute wait is over, meaning his drive takes at least four minutes.\nThis means Bernadette must leave *after* Wayne's four-minute wait, so any time after that until her drive takes at least 20 minutes.\nLet\u2019s say Bernadette leaves x minutes after Wayne\u2019s four-minute wait.\nIn those x minutes, Bernadette could have:\n-left her car, gone shopping, etc.\nAnd if Bernadette leaves x minutes after Wayne's four-minute wait, and before her own 20-minute wait, then she must leave before x + 20\n#### 20\n"}]}
