It is 1000\nSo, we will use this as our answer:\nThe average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than enrollment at\nButler High School in Texas.\nThe answer to the question is: the greater amount of students is\nSo the answer is delivered to you from the great beyond.\nThis is a fun problem to solve.\nSo the answer is: the greater amount of students is 1000.\n#### 1000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -56.85741473734379, "len_probs": 225, "answer": "\nNorman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.\nButler High School, the neighboring school, enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, or (3/4)*4000 = 3000 students.\nThe difference in average enrollment between the two schools is 4000-3000 = 1000.\nTherefore, the greater amount of students is 1000.
