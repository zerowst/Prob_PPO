How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?\n\nSolution:\nThe second lego boxed set had a total of\n500 x 3 = 1500 pieces.\nThe first lego boxed set had a total of\n1500 x\n<\n1\n4\n=\n375\npieces.\nThere is a total of\n500 +\n1500 +\n375 =\n2,875 pieces\nthat Johnny picks up.
