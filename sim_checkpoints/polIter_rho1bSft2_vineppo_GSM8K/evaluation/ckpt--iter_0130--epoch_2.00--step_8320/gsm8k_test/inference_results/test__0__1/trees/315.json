She invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?\n\nSolution:\nThe 2 families with 6 people had a total of 2*6 = 12 people.\nThe 3 families with 4 people had a total of 3*4 = 12 people.\nIn total, there were 12+12 = 24 people.\n8 people couldn't come, and 1/4 that number is 8*(1/4)= 2\nSo 24-8 = 16 people attended due to illness or other commitments.\nSo the answer to this question is 24-16 = 8 people. Oops!\nIt was a big oversight.\nThe correct answer is: 16 people attended\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.374651804566383, "len_probs": 159, "answer": "\nThe 2 families with 6 people had a total of 2*6 = 12 people.\nThe 3 families with 4 people had a total of 3*4 = 12 people.\nIn total, there were 12+12 = 24 people.\n8 people couldn't come, and 1/4 that number is 8*(1/4)= 2\nSo 24-8 = 16 people attended due to illness or other commitments.\nSo the answer to this question is 24-16 = 8 people.
