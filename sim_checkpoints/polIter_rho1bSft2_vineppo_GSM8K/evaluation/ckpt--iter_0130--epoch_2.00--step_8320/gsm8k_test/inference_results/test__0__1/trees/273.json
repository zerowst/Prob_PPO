How many stitches does each sleeve take?\n\nSolution:\nThe collar takes a tenth of the total stitch count of the body of the sweater, or\n(1/10)x900 = 90 stitches total\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches total\nThe total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900, 90, and 180\nIn total the sleeves have 900-total stitches,\nSo the number of stitches for the sleeves is also 900-x\nThe number for the two sleeves is\n2x\nwhich after you subtract the 90 stitches also gives 900-90 = 810 stitches for the two sleeves\nSo each sleeve takes 810/2 = 405 stitches.\n#### 405\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.14040243625641, "len_probs": 225, "answer": "\nThe collar takes a tenth of the total stitch count of the body of the sweater, or\n(1/10)x900 = 90 stitches total\nThe rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches total\nThe total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900, 90, and 180\nIn total the sleeves have 900-total stitches,\nSo the number of stitches for the sleeves is also 900-x\nThe number for the two sleeves is\n2x\nwhich after you subtract the 90 stitches also gives 900-90 = 810 stitches for the two sleeves\nSo each sleeve takes 810/2 = 405 stitches.\n#### 405\n"}, {"text": "\nThe collar takes a tenth of the total number of stitches in the body of the sweater, or 900/10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes twice the number of the collar, so it's 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.\nSo, the sleeve of the sweater is not a complete sleeve.\nThe remaining number of stitches are for the body, collar, and rosette put together, so 900-3\nThere is a total of 18\nSo each sleeve is  900-3/18\nOr, 900-3= 877 stitches.\n#### 877\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTerri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette.
