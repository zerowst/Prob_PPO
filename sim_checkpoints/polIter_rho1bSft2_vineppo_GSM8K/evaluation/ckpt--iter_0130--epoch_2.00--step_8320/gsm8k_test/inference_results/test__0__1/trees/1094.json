She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?\n\nSolution:\nEllen started with 12 sodas - 3 shaken, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken.\nHer brother took 1 shaken soda, so there were 3 left unshaken.\nAnd 2 of the unshaken sodas were taken by Ellen's friend, so there were 2 left.\nThese 3 were shaken so the total number of soda left is 9\nThe probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is $\\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{30\\%}$\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.515698567032814, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nEllen started with 12 sodas - 3 shaken, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken.\nHer brother took 1 shaken soda, so there were 3 left unshaken.\nAnd 2 of the unshaken sodas were taken by Ellen's friend, so there were 2 left.\nThese 3 were shaken so the total number of soda left is 9\nThe probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is $\\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{30\\%}$\n#### 30\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst figure out how many total sodas are in the case after Ellen took 1 out: 12 - 1 (her brother took one to give to his friend)\nThen figure out how many sodas are left after Ellen took her own shaken soda: 12 - 1 (her brother took one to give to his friend) - 1 (her own shaken soda)\nThen figure out how many total soda she had left after her brother took a soda and her friend took two: 12 - 1 - 1 (her brother's shaken soda) - 2 (her friend's two unshaken soda)\nNow, Ellen's friend could get a soda from any of the 6 remaining soda cans in the case.\nSo the probability of this happening: 6 / 12 = 50%\n#### 50\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nEllen decided to play a prank on her friend.
