He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?\n\nSolution:\nThe total pounds of hay is 42 * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds.\nThe total pounds of oats is 20 * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds.\nThe total pounds of carrots is 0.4 * (42 * 1 pound\n= 42 pounds\n42 pounds / 1 pound per\n= 42\nThe total pounds for all the vegetables is\n42 + 1300 + 0.4 * (42\n= 51\nThe total pounds for all the animals is\n3150 + 1300 + 51 = 4701 pounds.\nThe total amount of feet the farmer has to carry is\n42 + 14\n= 56\nThe total feet for one trip is 2250 - 56 = 2194 feet.\nThus, the number of trips he needs to transport is 2194 / 2\n= 1097\n#### 1097\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.38432864099741, "len_probs": 243, "answer": "\nThe total pounds of hay is 42 * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds.\nThe total pounds of oats is 20 * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds.\nThe total pounds of carrots is 0.4 * (42 * 1 pound\n= 42 pounds\n42 pounds / 1 pound per\n= 42\nThe total pounds for all the vegetables is\n42 + 1300 + 0.4 * (42\n= 51\nThe total pounds for all the animals is\n3150 + 1300 + 51 = 4701 pounds.\nThe total amount of feet the farmer has to carry is\n42 + 14\n= 56\nThe total feet for one trip is 2250 - 56 = 2194 feet.\nThus, the number of trips he needs to transport is 2194 / 2\n= 1097\n#### 1097\n"}]}
