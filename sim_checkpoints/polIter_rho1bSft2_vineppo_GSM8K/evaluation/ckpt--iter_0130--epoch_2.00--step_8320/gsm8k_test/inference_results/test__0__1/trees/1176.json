Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used up 45% of the chalk on Monday, which means he used 5\nThe remaining length of the chalk he needs to write with is 5 - (50% * 5)\nThat means he needs to write with 5 - (2.5) = 2.5\nHe was able to write 2.5 with today's piece of chalk\nHe had to recycle the piece because 2 < 2\nHe recycled today's piece because 5 / 0.05 = 100\nHe had to recycle 100 days because 2 / (0.05 / 1) = 20\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.44092673063278, "len_probs": 158, "answer": "\nThe teacher used up 45% of the chalk on Monday, which means he used 5\nThe remaining length of the chalk he needs to write with is 5 - (50% * 5)\nThat means he needs to write with 5 - (2.5) = 2.5\nHe was able to write 2.5 with today's piece of chalk\nHe had to recycle the piece because 2 < 2\nHe recycled today's piece because 5 / 0.05 = 100\nHe had to recycle 100 days because 2 / (0.05 / 1) = 20\n#### 10\n"}, {"text": "\nThe teacher used up 45% of the chalk because he wrote more than usual, so 45 / 100 *\n=> 5\nchalk pieces.\nHe had 10 pieces of chalk in the beginning, so he had to recycle 5 - 1\n=> 4\npieces of chalk.\nHe uses a new piece of chalk every 2 pieces, or 20 / 10 *\n=> 2\npieces of chalk for every 1 piece of new chalk.\n4 / 2 = 2 days in total to recycle the chalk.\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students.
