Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together. We know that Arnold and Madeline = x\nWe also know that Camden + Sarah = 30\nAnd Sarah = Camden - 12\nSo, Camden + Sarah = 30\nOr, Camden = 30 - 12 = 18\nTherefore, Arnold and Madeline painted together = x\nOr, 56 = x\nSo, x = 56\nThus, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 3 = 53 eggs together.\nAnd, Camden painted 18 - 1 = 17 total painted by Camden.\nTherefore, Camden painted = 17 - Arnold = 17 - 5 = 12 more eggs than Arnold.\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.458912406116724, "len_probs": 185, "answer": "\nLet x be the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together.
