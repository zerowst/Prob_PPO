At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?\n\nSolution:\nThe jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $6 = 22.\nHe saved a total of $6 from jogger jeans, which means he spent it on something else\nThe amount of money he spent on the other thing = 1/3 * $6 = $2\nHe saved $6 total from the tattered jeans = money spent on other thing\nSo the $2 difference = $2 - $1\nSo the answer is $1\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.203445825725794, "len_probs": 108, "answer": "\nThe jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $6 = 22.\nHe saved a total of $6 from jogger jeans, which means he spent it on something else\nThe amount of money he spent on the other thing = 1/3 * $6 = $2\nHe saved $6 total from the tattered jeans = money spent on other thing\nSo the $2 difference = $2 - $1\nSo the answer is $1\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nThe jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved a total of $6 / (1/3) = $18 from the jogger jeans\nSo he saved the rest $6 - $18 = -$12 from the tattered jeans.\nSo the original cost of the tattered jeans was $12 / 3 = $4.\nTherefore, the original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 - $4 = $18\nThe difference is $18 - $4 = $14.\nSo the other jeans originally cost $14 more than the tattered jeans.\nThere's a more detailed solution in the solution section below.\n#### 14\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest.
