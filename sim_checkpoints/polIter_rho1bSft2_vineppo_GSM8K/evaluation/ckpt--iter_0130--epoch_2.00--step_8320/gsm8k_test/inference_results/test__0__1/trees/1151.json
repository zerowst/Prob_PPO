If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?\n\nSolution:\nSid traveled a total distance of 110 + 140 = 250 miles.\nSid took a total time of 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\nThe average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\nThe average speed of Sid's travel is 50.\nThe answer is he average speed was the same because he traveled the same distance in the same amount of time because it was not an average of a different distance.\nThe average speed of a car is the distance divided by the time. Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the time it took. The only thing that changed was the time.\nThe average speed is still the same because it was the same distance in the same amount of time.\nThe average speed is the same because it is the same distance/time.\nThe average of 5 is 5 because it is the same distance/time\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -73.427201975137, "len_probs": 216, "answer": "\nSid traveled a total distance of 110 + 140 = 250 miles.\nSid took a total time of 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\nThe average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\nThe average speed of Sid's travel is 50.\nThe answer is he average speed was the same because he traveled the same distance in the same amount of time because it was not an average of a different distance.\nThe average speed of a car is the distance divided by the time.
