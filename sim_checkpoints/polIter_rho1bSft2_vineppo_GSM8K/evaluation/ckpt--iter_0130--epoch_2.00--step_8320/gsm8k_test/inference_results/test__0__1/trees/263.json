Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.  How many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard?\n\nSolution:\nChris has 6 trees.\nFerdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, or 6/2=3 trees.\nHarry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, or (2*3)+5 = 11 trees.\nTherefore, Harry has 11-3=8 more trees than Ferdinand's yard. That's an increase of 8 trees in total, because you have to subtract the trees that are in both of his and his father's yard.\n(or you can just count the trees in his yard and you'll see it's the same thing.)\nTherefore Harry has more trees because you can count it.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -57.33535362035036, "len_probs": 157, "answer": "\nChris has 6 trees.\nFerdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, or 6/2=3 trees.\nHarry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, or (2*3)+5 = 11 trees.\nTherefore, Harry has 11-3=8 more trees than Ferdinand's yard.
