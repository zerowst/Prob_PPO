With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?\n\nSolution:\nThe house has 8 rooms, so with a flashlight for every person, there are 4 people * 1 flashlight per person = 4 flashlights.\nThere are 8 rooms, so with two flashlights each, there are 4 rooms * 2 flashlights = 8 flashlights.\nThe variety candles are for half the rooms, so there are 3 rooms\nSo there are 3 rooms * 5 small candles per = 15 small candles.\nThe other half of the rooms have 3 rooms\nSo there are 3 rooms * 4 medium candles per = 12 medium candles.\nThe total number of small candles is 5 a\nThe total number of medium candles is 5\nSo the total number of candles is 15+total small candles\n+ 12+total medium candles\nSo the total number wanted is 15+12 = 27 candles.\nThe flashlights, 8 rooms\nThe total number for all the rooms, 4\nThe total number for all the rooms\nThey are 4 flashlights\n8 rooms\nThe total number 27\n#### 27\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -52.481439493596554, "len_probs": 264, "answer": "\nThe house has 8 rooms, so with a flashlight for every person, there are 4 people * 1 flashlight per person = 4 flashlights.\nThere are 8 rooms, so with two flashlights each, there are 4 rooms * 2 flashlights = 8 flashlights.\nThe variety candles are for half the rooms, so there are 3 rooms\nSo there are 3 rooms * 5 small candles per = 15 small candles.\nThe other half of the rooms have 3 rooms\nSo there are 3 rooms * 4 medium candles per = 12 medium candles.\nThe total number of small candles is 5 a\nThe total number of medium candles is 5\nSo the total number of candles is 15+total small candles\n+ 12+total medium candles\nSo the total number wanted is 15+12 = 27 candles.\nThe flashlights, 8 rooms\nThe total number for all the rooms, 4\nThe total number for all the rooms\nThey are 4 flashlights\n8 rooms\nThe total number 27\n#### 27\n"}]}
