For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?\n\nSolution:\nThe mechanic repaired 6 truck tires on Thursday, so he earned $60 per tire = $6*6 = $36.\nThe mechanic repaired 4 car tires on Thursday, so he earned $40 per tire = $4*4 = $16.\nOn Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, so he didn't earn $60 per tire = $0.\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, so he earned $40 per tire = $40*12 = $480.\nThus, the mechanic earned $480 - $36 + $16 = $508 total revenue on the day with higher revenue.\nTherefore, the differenceRevenue = $508 - $464 = $44\n#### 44\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.645378775894642, "len_probs": 211, "answer": "\nThe mechanic repaired 6 truck tires on Thursday, so he earned $60 per tire = $6*6 = $36.\nThe mechanic repaired 4 car tires on Thursday, so he earned $40 per tire = $4*4 = $16.\nOn Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, so he didn't earn $60 per tire = $0.\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, so he earned $40 per tire = $40*12 = $480.\nThus, the mechanic earned $480 - $36 + $16 = $508 total revenue on the day with higher revenue.\nTherefore, the differenceRevenue = $508 - $464 = $44\n#### 44\n"}, {"text": "\nThe mechanic charged $60/tire x 6 truck tires = $360 for truck tires.\nThe mechanic charged $40/tire x 4 car tires = $160 for car tires.\nThus on Thursday the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520.\nOn Friday, the mechanic earned $0 from car tires, so it was $0\nThe difference is $520 - $0 = $520.\nThe mechanic earned more $520 on Friday than on Thursday, after removing the $10 difference in revenue between the two days.\n#### 520\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.
