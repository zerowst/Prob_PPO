By contract, Octavia\u2019s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan\u2019s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?\n\nSolution:\nJuan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, or 10 * 1/2 cups of coffee, which is the same as\n10 * 1/2 = 5 cups of coffee.\nHe must reduce\n4 - 5 =\n$\\boxed{1}$ cup of coffee per day.\nTo do this, we can imagine that he has to drink this amount of coffee\nin 4\n$\\frac{4}{5}$ cups\nof time, since he\u2019s\nactually drinking\n$\\frac{4}{5}$ cups\nof coffee per day.\nThere are other ways to do this because it is a negative amount\nof coffee.\nAnother way to say that you have to have a negative number of cups of coffee\nis to say that you have to have zero. This is the same as saying that you\nhave to drink more than one cup of coffee, since\nyou have to drink more than\n$\\frac{4}{5}$ cups of coffee.\nThis means that\n$4 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) < 0$\nor\n$4 - \\frac{4}{5} < 0$\nor\n$20 - 4 < 5$\nor\n$16 < 5$\nThe answer is true.\nThis is a good exercise to understand the concept of a negative amount of coffee.\nThis is a trick question because the doctor wants Juan to drink only 4 cups a day.\nSo the answer is $1$ cup.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -107.30463056638837, "len_probs": 347, "answer": "\nJuan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, or 10 * 1/2 cups of coffee, which is the same as\n10 * 1/2 = 5 cups of coffee.\nHe must reduce\n4 - 5 =\n$\\boxed{1}$ cup of coffee per day.\nTo do this, we can imagine that he has to drink this amount of coffee\nin 4\n$\\frac{4}{5}$ cups\nof time, since he\u2019s\nactually drinking\n$\\frac{4}{5}$ cups\nof coffee per day.\nThere are other ways to do this because it is a negative amount\nof coffee.\nAnother way to say that you have to have a negative number of cups of coffee\nis to say that you have to have zero.
