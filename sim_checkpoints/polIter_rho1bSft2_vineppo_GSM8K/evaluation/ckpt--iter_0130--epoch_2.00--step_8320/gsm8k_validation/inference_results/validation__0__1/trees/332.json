Staying at the hotel cost was $1.50 per hour every night and $2 per hour every morning. If Ed had $80 and he stayed in the hotel for 6 hours last night and 4 hours this morning, how much money was he left with after paying for his stay at the hotel?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for staying at the hotel last night is 6 x $1.50 = $9.\nThe total cost for staying at the hotel this morning is 4 x $2 = $8.\nSo the total cost for staying at the hotel for 6 + 4 days is $9 + $8 = $17.\nTherefore, Ed was left with $80 - $17 = $63 after paying for the hotel stay.\nHence, the hotel bill was paid.\nIt is not a big deal. It is a good practice to solve such problems.\nMoreover, it helps to understand the concepts of money and how it is calculated.\nSo, Ed was left $63 after paying the hotel bill.\nDo you have to pay the hotel bill?
