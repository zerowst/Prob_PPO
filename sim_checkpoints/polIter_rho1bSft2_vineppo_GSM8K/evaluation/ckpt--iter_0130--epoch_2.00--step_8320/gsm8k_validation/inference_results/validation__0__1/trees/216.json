To check the final temperature of her dish, Jenny can turn off the oven and use it for cooking at the same time. Jenny could also use this time to turn off the oven if she wants to use the oven for something else. The oven is in a state of \u201cheating\u201d until it reaches the desired temperature, so it is safe to assume that Jenny would want to use it for cooking.\n#### 16\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJenny wants to heat a dish for dinner.  It needs to be at 100 degrees before it is ready to eat.  It is 20 degrees when she places it in the oven, and it heats up 5 degrees every minute.  How many minutes will it take to be ready?\n\nSolution:\nThe oven temperature needs to reach 100 degrees, and it currently has a temperature of 20 degrees, so it needs to heat up 100 - 20 = 80 degrees.\nThe oven temperature increases at a rate of 5 degrees per minute, so it will take 80 / 5 = 16 minutes for Jenny\u2019s dish to heat up in the oven.\nThe dish takes 16 minutes to heat up in the oven, which will be the final time it takes. Jenny could also use this time to turn off the oven if she wants to use the oven for something else. The oven is in a state of \u201cheating\u201d until it reaches the desired temperature, so it is safe to assume that Jenny would want to use it for cooking.\nA \u201cminute\u201d is a unit of time that is defined as 60 seconds.\nA \u201cminute\u201d is a unit of time that is defined as 60 seconds.\nA \u201cminute\u201d is a unit of time that is defined as 60 seconds.\nTherefore, Jenny\u2019s dish takes 1 minute per 5\n<br><br>It will take Jenny 16 minutes in total for her dish to heat up in the oven.
