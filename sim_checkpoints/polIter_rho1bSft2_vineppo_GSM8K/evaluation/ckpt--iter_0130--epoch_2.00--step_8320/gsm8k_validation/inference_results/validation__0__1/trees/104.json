She rode her bicycle slowly to the high school, rode four miles around the running track at her faster, race pace, and then rode back home, slowly, on the same route. If her total mileage was 10 miles, how far is it, in miles, from Layla's house to the high school?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the distance from Layla's house to the high school.\nThe total distance of the trip is given by the equation:\nx + 4 + x = 10\nCombining like terms, we get:\n2x + 4 = 10\nCombining the 4 into the same group we get:\n2x = 6\nSo the distance from Layla's house to the high school is x = 3 miles.\nThe distance from her house to the school is a part of her journey, and it is not the same as the distance from her house to her house.\nThe distance from her house to the school is: x, which is 3 miles.\nThe total distance of her journey, from her house to the park, is not the same as this distance because it is not the same part of her journey.\nThe distance from her house to the park is: x, which is 3 miles.\nThe distance from her house to her house is a different distance.\nThe distance from her house to her house is a part of the distance from her house to the park, but it is not the same distance.
