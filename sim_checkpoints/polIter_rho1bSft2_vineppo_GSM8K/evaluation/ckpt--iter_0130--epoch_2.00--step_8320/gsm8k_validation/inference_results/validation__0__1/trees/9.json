The first stack was 7 blocks tall. The second stack was 3 blocks taller than the first. The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe second stack has 7 + 3 = 10 blocks.\nThe third stack has 10 - 6 = 4 blocks.\nThe fourth stack has 4 + (the difference between the cost of the blocks in the 3rd stack and the 2nd stack).\nSo, the number of blocks in the 4th stack =\nTherefore, the total blocks in the stacks of 4 in the sequence is 7 + 10 + 4 + x =\nIn total, Thomas used 7 + 10 + 4 + x = 21 + x blocks.\n#### 21 + x\n#### 21\n#### <a>21</a>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.14417161047459, "len_probs": 168, "answer": "\nThe second stack has 7 + 3 = 10 blocks.\nThe third stack has 10 - 6 = 4 blocks.\nThe fourth stack has 4 + (the difference between the cost of the blocks in the 3rd stack and the 2nd stack).\nSo, the number of blocks in the 4th stack =\nTherefore, the total blocks in the stacks of 4 in the sequence is 7 + 10 + 4 + x =\nIn total, Thomas used 7 + 10 + 4 + x = 21 + x blocks.\n#### 21 + x\n#### 21\n#### <a>21</a>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### 21\n"}]}
