So, we can calculate the total time as 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours of work time.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much money John makes from his work after the 8-hour workday. We know he makes $80 a day and works for 10 hours, so we need to add those numbers together to get the total amount of money he makes $80\n\nSo, $80 a day * 10 hours = $800 total.\n\nNow we need to subtract the money he earned from the bonus because he didn't earn the performance bonus. We know he makes $80 a day and earns $20 per hour. So, we need to figure out how many hours in total he works on his own time. We do this by subtracting his 8-hour workday from the total work time of 10 hours. 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours of work time that he did not earn money from.\n\nSo, $800 total earnings - $640 (the money he earned from his regular hours) = $160 from his own time.\n\nFinally, we divide this amount by the number of hours he worked on his own to get the $8 per hour he earned from the bonus. We get 160 / 2 = $8 per hour.\n#### 8\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJohn works a job that offers performance bonuses.  He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours.  He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n\nSolution:\nThe first thing we need to do is figure out the total amount of time John works with the bonus. We know he works 8 hours, but we should also know that he has an extra 2 hours of work time because of his bonus.
