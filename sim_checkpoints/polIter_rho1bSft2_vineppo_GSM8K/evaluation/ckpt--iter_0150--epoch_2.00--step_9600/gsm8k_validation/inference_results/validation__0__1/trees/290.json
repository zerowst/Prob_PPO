Twice as many are eaten by squirrels as reindeer. 25% of the remainder are collected to make fires. How many pinecones are left?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find how many pinecones were eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 = 400.\nThen find how many pinecones were twice as many: 400 x 2 = 800.\nNow find how many pinecones were eaten in total by reindeer and squirrels: 800\nSubtract this number from the original total to find the squirrels left: 2000 - 800 = 1200.\nThen find how many pinecones were collected for fires: 25% * 1200 = 300.\nSubtract this amount from the squirrels left: 1200 - 300 = 900. So the final step is to leave one. Only one pinecone left.\n#### 900\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.080587320029736, "len_probs": 209, "answer": "\nFirst find how many pinecones were eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 = 400.\nThen find how many pinecones were twice as many: 400 x 2 = 800.\nNow find how many pinecones were eaten in total by reindeer and squirrels: 800\nSubtract this number from the original total to find the squirrels left: 2000 - 800 = 1200.\nThen find how many pinecones were collected for fires: 25% * 1200 = 300.\nSubtract this amount from the squirrels left: 1200 - 300 = 900.
