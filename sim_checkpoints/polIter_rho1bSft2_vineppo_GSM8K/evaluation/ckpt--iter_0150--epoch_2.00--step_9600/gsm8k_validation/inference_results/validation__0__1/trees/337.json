He also needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, each with 7 flowers, and it takes him half a minute to plant each flower. How many minutes will Carson spend gardening?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how long it takes him to mow all the lines by multiplying the lines by the time per line: 40 lines * 2 min/line = 80 min\nThen figure out how many flowers he plants with the other half of the time. Each of his 8 rows of flowers has 7 flowers so he plants 8*7 = 56 flowers.\nHalf of 56 flowers is 56*0.5 = 28 flowers\nSo it takes him 80 -\n8\nto take away the ones he didn't get right out of a box of 5\nSo the answer is 80-8=72\n#### 72\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.40285820886493, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how long it takes him to mow all the lines by multiplying the lines by the time per line: 40 lines * 2 min/line = 80 min\nThen figure out how many flowers he plants with the other half of the time.
