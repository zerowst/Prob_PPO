The white T-shirts come in packs of 6, and the blue T-shirts come in packs of 4. How many T-shirts did Dave buy in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of white T-shirts is 3 x 6 = 18.\nAnd the total number of blue T-shirts is 2 x 4 = 8.\nHence, Dave bought 18 + 8 = 26 T-shirts. [Though you can't get a half T-shirt, Dave got 1 whole T-shirt less than this case\nSo the answer is 26.]\nOr you can also do\n3 x 6 (as he bought less than a whole number of white T-shirts in a single pack),\nand 2 x 4\n(which will show you how you got the 8 and 18 to come out that he bought, respectively).\nHe bought the same number of packs of each type of shirt, so you can just add the numbers together to find the total number of items he bought: 18 + 8 = 26.\n#### 26\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -87.53123392350972, "len_probs": 219, "answer": "\nThe total number of white T-shirts is 3 x 6 = 18.\nAnd the total number of blue T-shirts is 2 x 4 = 8.\nHence, Dave bought 18 + 8 = 26 T-shirts.
