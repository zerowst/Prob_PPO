If Ed had $80 and he stayed in the hotel for 6 hours last night and 4 hours this morning, how much money was he left with after paying for his stay at the hotel?\n\nSolution:\nThe hotel charges for 6:\nCost per hour *\n= $9\n\nThe hotel charges for 4:\nCost per hour *\n= $6\n\nThe total spent at the hotel is $9 + $6 = $15.\n\nHe was left $80 - $15 = $65 after paying for the hotel. This means Ed left his remaining amount with this amount because $\nSo the answer is 65.\n\nPlease note that this is the general rule for this particular problem.
