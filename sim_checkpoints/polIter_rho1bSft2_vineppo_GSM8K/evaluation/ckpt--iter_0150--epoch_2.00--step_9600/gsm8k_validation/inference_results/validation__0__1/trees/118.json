But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nSolution:\nThe distance traveled due east for 20 hours at 30 kilometers per hour gives 20 * 30 = 600 kilometers.\nThe distance between the starting point and his final destination is two-thirds (as the third-party app told him that he was only 1/3 of the way there, so it didn't count the last half of the journey). Thus, the distance is 600 * 2 / 3 = 400 kilometers.\nThe wind storm blew his ship backward 1/3 of the distance, so the storm blew 400 * 1/3 = 133 kilometers in a westward direction.\n#### 133\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.257872518152, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nThe distance traveled due east for 20 hours at 30 kilometers per hour gives 20 * 30 = 600 kilometers.\nThe distance between the starting point and his final destination is two-thirds (as the third-party app told him that he was only 1/3 of the way there, so it didn't count the last half of the journey).
