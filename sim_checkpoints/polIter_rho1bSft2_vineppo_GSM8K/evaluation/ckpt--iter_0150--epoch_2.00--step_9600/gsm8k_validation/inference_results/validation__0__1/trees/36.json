How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer?\n\nSolution:\nThe loan term is 20 years.\nThe monthly payment for the house loan would be $480,000 divided by the loan amount times the term in years, or 480,000 / (20*12) = $500\nThe monthly payment for the trailer loan would be $120,000 divided by the loan amount times the term in years, or 120,000 / (20*12) = $100\nSo, the difference in monthly payments is $500 - $100 = $400.\n#### The monthly payment on the house is $400 more than the payment on the trailer. 4\n#### <span>400</span>\n#### <span>400</span>\n#### 400\n</span>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.johndoe.com/\">John</a>\n#### <a href=\"https://www.joh", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -26.217411868274212, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe loan term is 20 years.\nThe monthly payment for the house loan would be $480,000 divided by the loan amount times the term in years, or 480,000 / (20*12) = $500\nThe monthly payment for the trailer loan would be $120,000 divided by the loan amount times the term in years, or 120,000 / (20*12) = $100\nSo, the difference in monthly payments is $500 -
