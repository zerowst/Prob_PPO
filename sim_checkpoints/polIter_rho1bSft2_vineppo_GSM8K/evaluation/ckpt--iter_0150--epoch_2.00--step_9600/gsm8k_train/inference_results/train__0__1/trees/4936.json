A friend knows that Kim has a bunch of shiny new earrings that she loves. She agrees to give Kim 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings. On the first day, Kim brings her 3 pairs of earrings. On the second she brings her twice as many. On the third day, she brings 1 less than she brought on the second day. If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, she brought 3 pairs = 6 pairs\nShe brought twice as many on the second day = 6 pairs * <\n= 12 pairs\nOn the third day = 12 pairs - 1\n= 11 pairs\nShe brought 3\nShe came up with\n9 * 3 +\n9 *\n(12 pairs / pairs\n=\n9 *\n3 +\n9 *\n12\n=\n9\n*\n3\n=\n27\ndays\n#### 27\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.937960401177406, "len_probs": 118, "answer": "\nOn the first day, she brought 3 pairs = 6 pairs\nShe brought twice as many on the second day = 6 pairs * <\n= 12 pairs\nOn the third day = 12 pairs - 1\n= 11 pairs\nShe brought 3\nShe came up with\n9 * 3 +\n9 *\n(12 pairs / pairs\n=\n9 *\n3 +\n9 *\n12\n=\n9\n*\n3\n=\n27\ndays\n#### 27\n"}]}
