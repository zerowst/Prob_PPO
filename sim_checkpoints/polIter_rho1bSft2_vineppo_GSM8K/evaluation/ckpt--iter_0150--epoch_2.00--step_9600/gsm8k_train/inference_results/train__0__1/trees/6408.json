She walks 3 blocks north, then seven times as many blocks west. Then she turns around and walks 8 blocks south and twice as many blocks east in the direction of her home. If Janet can walk 2 blocks/minute, how long will it take her to get home?\n\nSolution:\nJanet first walks 3 blocks to the north. She then walks 7 times that amount west, for a distance of 3*7=21 blocks.\nJanet then turns her walk direction and walks 8 blocks south.\nShe then turns her walk direction and walks 2 times that amount (since she's walking in a direction that's already been walked upon) for a distance of: 8*2=16 blocks\nShe walks 2\nSo the total distance she's walked is\n3+21+8+16 = 50 blocks.\nShe walks the distance of 10\nIt will take her 50/2= 25 minutes to get home.\n#### 25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.60410834848881, "len_probs": 166, "answer": "\nJanet first walks 3 blocks to the north.
