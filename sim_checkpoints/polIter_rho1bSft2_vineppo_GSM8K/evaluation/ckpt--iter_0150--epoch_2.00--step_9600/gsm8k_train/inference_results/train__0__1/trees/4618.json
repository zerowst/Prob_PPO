What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?\n\nSolution:\nThe larger box cost $4.80\nThe average cost per ounce of this box is $4.80 / 30 = $0.16\nThe smaller box cost $3.40\nThe average cost per ounce of this box is $3.40 / 20 = $0.17\nThe answer is $0.17 is the better value because it has less total cost\nThe average price per ounce among the 5 boxes total cost is: $0.\nThe average price per ounce of the 4 less-expensive boxes = $0\nThe answer is 4 < 5;\nSo the answer is $0\n#### 17\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.567778207361698, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nThe larger box cost $4.80\nThe average cost per ounce of this box is $4.80 / 30 = $0.16\nThe smaller box cost $3.40\nThe average cost per ounce of this box is $3.40 / 20 = $0.17\nThe answer is $0.17 is the better value because it has less total cost\nThe average price per ounce among the 5 boxes total cost is: $0.\nThe average price per ounce of the 4 less-expensive boxes = $0\nThe answer is 4 < 5;\nSo the answer is $0\n#### 17\n"}, {"text": "\nThe larger box costs $4.80\nThe smaller box costs $3.40\nThe difference in cost is $4.80 - $3.40 = $1.40.\nThe larger box is bigger, so it\u2019s a better deal, but we\u2019re not going to say that it\u2019s $1.40\nThere\u2019s no \u201ceasily divided\u201d number to speak of here, so we have to find an answer that is a whole number.
