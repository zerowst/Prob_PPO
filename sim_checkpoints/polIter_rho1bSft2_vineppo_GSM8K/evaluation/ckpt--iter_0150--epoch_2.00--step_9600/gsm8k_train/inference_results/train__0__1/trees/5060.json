An odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2, meaning it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\nThus, the bicycle is an odd-numbered bicycle.\nThe answer: 60.\n#### 60.\n#### 60\nOddness\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -41.331342838704586, "len_probs": 165, "answer": "\nThe back wheel has 20 x 2 = 40 spokes.\nThus\u2019s the total number of spokes is 20 + 40 = 60.
