Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?\n\nSolution:\nTwo apples fell out of the tree, and then one was thrown into the tree for a net loss of: 2 - 1 = 1 apple.\n5 more apples fell out, so the net loss then was 1+5 = 6 apples.\nTwo apples were thrown at the tree, so to make the number match, Newton threw one more apple into the tree\nTwo+1 = 3 apples\nNewton picked up 3-1=2 apples and threw them back\n2 remain\nTherefore he brought home 2 apples that he didn't throw away because he was going to make a pie\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -46.5637903213501, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nTwo apples fell out of the tree, and then one was thrown into the tree for a net loss of: 2 - 1 = 1 apple.\n5 more apples fell out, so the net loss then was 1+5 = 6 apples.\nTwo apples were thrown at the tree, so to make the number match, Newton threw one more apple into the tree\nTwo+1 = 3 apples\nNewton picked up 3-1=2 apples and threw them back\n2 remain\nTherefore he brought home 2 apples that he didn't throw away because he was going to make a pie\n#### 2\n"}]}
