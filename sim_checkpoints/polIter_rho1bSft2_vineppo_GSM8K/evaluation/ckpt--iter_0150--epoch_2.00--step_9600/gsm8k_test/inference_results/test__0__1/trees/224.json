If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?\n\nSolution:\nCarlos used the canoe for 3 hours, so he has to pay: $30 * 3 = 90 dollars.\nBenji used the raft for 5 hours, so he has to pay: $18 * 5 = 90 dollars.\nSo in the beginning they cost together\n90 + 90 = 180 dollars. As they are both friends they don't have to split the money, so they are done.\nBoth friends will pay the money in this situation so it will take just a couple of minutes for you to get the final amount of just one more friend.\n#### 180\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -63.427204467356205, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nCarlos used the canoe for 3 hours, so he has to pay: $30 * 3 = 90 dollars.\nBenji used the raft for 5 hours, so he has to pay: $18 * 5 = 90 dollars.\nSo in the beginning they cost together\n90 + 90 = 180 dollars.
