The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?\n\nSolution:\nThe distance the train goes from city A to city B, then from city B to city C, and then from city C to city A is: 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\nThe distance the 3 trains travel from city C back to city C in one trip is: 175 miles less =\n175 - 50 = 125 miles.\nIt goes this distance 3 times a day, so total distance it goes between services = 3 * 125 = 375 miles.\nIt takes 375 miles / 18,000 miles per service = 0.208 days between services.\n#### 0.208\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.233665093779564, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nThe distance the train goes from city A to city B, then from city B to city C, and then from city C to city A is: 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\nThe distance the 3 trains travel from city C back to city C in one trip is: 175 miles less =\n175 - 50 = 125 miles.\nIt goes this distance 3 times a day, so total distance it goes between services = 3 * 125 = 375 miles.\nIt takes 375 miles / 18,000 miles per service = 0.208 days between services.\n#### 0.208\n"}, {"text": "\nThe distance from the second city to the first city and back is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\nThe distance between the second city and the third city:\nThe first calculation\n75\n+\n50\n=\n125\nmile\nso it goes\n175\nmiles -\n50\nmiles\n=\n125\nmiles\nfrom\nthird city\nto\nfirst city\nso\n125\nmiles x 3 =\n375\nmiles\nit goes between the three cities.\nIt takes 375 miles 3 times\nSo it takes 375/18,000 = 0.02\nSo it needs service every 18 days\n#### 0\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA train travels between 3 different cities.
