The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?\n\nSolution:\nThe extra 20% added to the cost of the first brand of coffee made it 5 + (0.20)*5 = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\nSo, he bought three pounds of the first brand of coffee that cost a total of 3*5 = $15.\nThe second brand of coffee was twice the amount\nSo, he paid for it\n$6 * 1 = $6\nSo in total \n$15 + $6 + $2 = $23\n#### 23\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.388540394604206, "len_probs": 121, "answer": "\nThe extra 20% added to the cost of the first brand of coffee made it 5 + (0.20)*5 = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\nSo, he bought three pounds of the first brand of coffee that cost a total of 3*5 = $15.\nThe second brand of coffee was twice the amount\nSo, he paid for it\n$6 * 1 = $6\nSo in total \n$15 + $6 + $2 = $23\n#### 23\n"}]}
