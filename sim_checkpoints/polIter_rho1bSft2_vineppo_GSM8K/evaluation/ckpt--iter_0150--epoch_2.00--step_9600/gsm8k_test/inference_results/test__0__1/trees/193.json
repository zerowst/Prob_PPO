On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?\n\nSolution:\nOn Saturday morning, the neighbors took back 6 (one third * 18)).\nThis added 6 * 1 = 6 white plastic flamingos back.\nThere were 18 + 6 = 24 white plastic flamingos.\nThen on Sunday morning, they added 18 more plastic flamingos, so the total number became 24 + 18 = 42 plastic flamingos.\nTherefore, there were 42 - 4 = 48 more flamingo than pink\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.24658576399088, "len_probs": 129, "answer": "\nOn Saturday morning, the neighbors took back 6 (one third * 18)).\nThis added 6 * 1 = 6 white plastic flamingos back.\nThere were 18 + 6 = 24 white plastic flamingos.\nThen on Sunday morning, they added 18 more plastic flamingos, so the total number became 24 + 18 = 42 plastic flamingos.\nTherefore, there were 42 - 4 = 48 more flamingo than pink\n#### 48\n"}]}
