She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?\n\nSolution:\nCindy had twice 5 green eggs, that is 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.\nShe had one fewer pink egg than the 10 blue, so it\u2019s 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.\nShe had one-third as many yellow eggs as the 9 blue, so it\u2019s 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.\nAltogether, she had the 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 33 eggs.\n#### The answer to the question is 33.\nThe correct answer was: \u201cShe had a basket full of eggs\u201d.\n#### Thank you for the correction, I\u2019m sorry.
