They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran his track 15*2=30 times.\nKelly ran 15*1\nAnd then 34*1\nSo Kelly ran \n47\nmore than Blake (since 15*34=495, but we know that 47 is a multiple of a 5 so it will cancel out with a 5 in Blakes total run, leaving her with a difference of 0)\nSo the answer is 30-47 = -17\n#### 17\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.75154872611165, "len_probs": 120, "answer": "\nBlake ran his track 15*2=30 times.\nKelly ran 15*1\nAnd then 34*1\nSo Kelly ran \n47\nmore than Blake (since 15*34=495, but we know that 47 is a multiple of a 5 so it will cancel out with a 5 in Blakes total run, leaving her with a difference of 0)\nSo the answer is 30-47 = -17\n#### 17\n"}]}
