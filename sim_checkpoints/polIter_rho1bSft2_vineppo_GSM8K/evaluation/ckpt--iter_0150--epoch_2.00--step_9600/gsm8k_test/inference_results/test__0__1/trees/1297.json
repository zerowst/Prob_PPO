The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?\n\nSolution:\nThe cost of passion fruit per jar = $6/pound\nThe cost of jackfruit per jar = $8/pound\nThe cost of honey per jar = $10/pound\n\nThe total cost of these ingredients for making one jar\n= (2 * $6/pound) + (1.5 * $8/pound) + $10/pound\n= $12 + $12 + $10\n= $34 per jar\n\nThe selling price of these ingredients for making one jar\n= $50\n\nSo profit for these ingredients for making one\n= $50 - $34 = $16 per jar\n\nIf he sells 10 of these,\nSo profit = 10 * $16 = $160\n#### 160\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.03635822236538, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nThe cost of passion fruit per jar = $6/pound\nThe cost of jackfruit per jar = $8/pound\nThe cost of honey per jar = $10/pound\n\nThe total cost of these ingredients for making one jar\n= (2 * $6/pound) + (1.5 * $8/pound) + $10/pound\n= $12 + $12 + $10\n= $34 per jar\n\nThe selling price of these ingredients for making one jar\n= $50\n\nSo profit for these ingredients for making one\n= $50 - $34 = $16 per jar\n\nIf he sells 10 of these,\nSo profit = 10 * $16 = $160\n#### 160\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the cost of the passion fruit per jar: $6/pound\nThat means it\u2019s 2 pounds *\nIt\u2019s $12 for the passion fruit.\n\nThen find the cost of the jackfruit per jar: $8/pound\nThat means it\u2019s 1.5 pounds *\nIt\u2019s $12 for the jackfruit.\n\nThen find the cost of the honey per jar: $10/pound\nThat means it\u2019s 2 pounds *\nIt\u2019s $20 for the honey.\n\nNow add all three quantities up to find total cost: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44\nNow multiply the cost by the number of jars to find whole number: $44 * 10 = $440\nThen find the profit: $440 - (2 * (4 * $50 - $44))\n= $440 - (2 * (4 * $50 - $44))\n= $440 - (2 * (200 - $44))\n= $440 - (2 * $156)\n= $440 - $312\n= $128\n#### 128\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim makes a special honey and jam mix.
