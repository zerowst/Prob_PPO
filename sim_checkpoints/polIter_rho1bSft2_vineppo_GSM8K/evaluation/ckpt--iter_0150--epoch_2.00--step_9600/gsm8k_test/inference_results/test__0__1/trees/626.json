To convert this speed to a unit that is easier to work with, we can first divide by 8, as there are 8 bits in a byte (the unit of the original 20kb speed). This gives us 20/8= 2.5 kb per second.\nTo find out how many kb per hour Ashley\u2019s speed is, we need to know that 1 hour has 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So we divide 2.5 by 6 to get the speed in Mb per hour (we can tell that it\u2019s 60 seconds in a minute and 8 bits in a byte because those are the units we used to convert from kb/s to mb/h).\nThat gives us 2.5/6=0.428 Mb per hour. (rounded to 4 decimal places).\n#### 428\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, we convert the internet speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:\n20 kb/s / (1000) = 0.02 Mb/s.\nThen we multiply the speed by 60 (seconds/hour) to get the speed in Mb/hour:\n0.02 Mb/s x 60 = 1 Mb/hour.\nSo the answer is 1 Mb/hour.
