After fifteen days, how many new limbs will Helena\u2019s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?\n\nSolution:\nThe first set of three-day periods that will cause the person to grow an arm is 1, 4, and 7 (because 3 days x\nthree-day periods = one\nfour-day period =\none\n+ five days\n= five\ndays;\nfive\n+ five\n= ten\ndays later\n). There are three of these periods so she gets 3 arms.\nThe first set of five-day periods that will cause the person to grow a leg is 1, 6, and 11 (because 5 days x\nthree-day periods = one\nsix-day period =\none\n+ three days\n= four\ndays;\nfour\n+ four\n= eight\ndays later\n).
