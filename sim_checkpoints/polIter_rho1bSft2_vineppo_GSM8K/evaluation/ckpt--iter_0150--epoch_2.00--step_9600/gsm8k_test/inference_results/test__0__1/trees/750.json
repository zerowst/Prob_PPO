During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of weekdays in four weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.\nSo, the total number of chairs during these 4 weeks is 28 * 60 = 1680 chairs.\nThe total number of weekends in four weeks = 4 * 2 = 8 days.\nSo, the total number of chairs during these weekend periods is 8 * 100 = 800 chairs.\nHence, the total amount of rented chairs is 1680 + 800 = 2480 chairs.
