His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?\n\nSolution:\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 20+15+20+15 = 70 feet.\nHence he needs the word of length \"70 feet of crepe paper\" to hang his birthday party streamers. The result is a number of the word \"70\" in the bold style.\nThe final word \"of\" translates to \"of\": \"having 70\" or \"having(ing) 70\".\nThe number of crepe-paper streamers that can be bought with 70 feet of ribbon is seven units, or \"7 units of crepe-paper streamer\", since \"7 units of crepe\" is the second-most common phrase in the bold.\nThe \"7\" is in bold because crepe-paper streamers are often referred to as \"streamers\" and this phrase is repeated in this word.\nThe result is \"7 crepe-paper streamers\", a phrase that is not in the original word.\nSo, James needs to buy \"7 units of crepe-paper streamer\" or \"a bundle of 7 crepe-paper streamers\" to get \"70 feet of crepe paper\".\nThe final word \"of\" translates to \"of\": \"having 70\" or \"having(ing) 70\".\nThe number of crepe-paper streamers that can be bought with 70 feet of ribbon is seven units, or \"7 units of crepe-paper streamer\", since \"7 units of crepe\" is the second-most common phrase in the bold.\n#### \"7\"\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">7</span>\n#### \"7 units of crepe-paper streamer\"\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">7</span> units of <span style=\"color:blue;\">crepe</span>-<span style=\"color:blue;\">paper</span> streamer\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">70</span>\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">feet</span> of <span style=\"color:blue;\">crepe</span>-<span style=\"color:blue;\">paper</span> streamer\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">7</span>\n#### \"70 feet of crepe paper\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">of</span>\n#### <span style=\"color:blue;\">crepe</span>-<span style=\"color:blue;\">paper</span> streamer\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n#### \"70\"\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -127.10286349058151, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 20+15+20+15 = 70 feet.\nHence he needs the word of length \"70 feet of crepe paper\" to hang his birthday party streamers.
