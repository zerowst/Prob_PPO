While charging her friends\u2019 phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the initial charge of the power bank.\nThe battery lost an amount each hour = 9% * x * 5 = 4.5x\nThe battery lost an additional amount over 3 hours = 7% * (total over 3 hours\nThe total lost is thus the initial minus the first loss, or\n= x - 4.5x * 3 / 10\n= x * (1 - 4.5/3 * 10)\n= x * (1 - 15)\n= x * 14\nSo the charge was x * 14 = 28\nSo the answer is x = 28 / 14 = 2\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.30302973091602, "len_probs": 160, "answer": "\nLet x be the initial charge of the power bank.\nThe battery lost an amount each hour = 9% * x * 5 = 4.5x\nThe battery lost an additional amount over 3 hours = 7% * (total over 3 hours\nThe total lost is thus the initial minus the first loss, or\n= x - 4.5x * 3 / 10\n= x * (1 - 4.5/3 * 10)\n= x * (1 - 15)\n= x * 14\nSo the charge was x * 14 = 28\nSo the answer is x = 28 / 14 = 2\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total charge lost over 5 hours is 5*0.09 = 45%\nThe total charge lost over 3 after 7%\nThey\u2019re charging 7-\nThey were charging at\nSo 3\nHours * 6\nTo be\n28\nSo the answer is 84\n#### 84\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMaria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn\u2019t fully charged yet.
