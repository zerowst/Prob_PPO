He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe oven raised the temperature by 3*5 = 15 degrees.\nSo the temperature after he spent 3 hours baking is 40+15 = 55 degrees.\nHe then let the window open for 30/60 = 0\nThe temperature dropped by 2 degrees because the window was not open for more than 30\nThe temperature was 55-0 = 55 degrees.\nFinally, the window cooled the temperature by 3/1\nThe temperature dropped 2 degrees\nSo the final temperature is 55-(3/1)*30 = 55-90 = -35 degrees\n#### 55\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.45160339400172, "len_probs": 153, "answer": "\nThe oven raised the temperature by 3*5 = 15 degrees.\nSo the temperature after he spent 3 hours baking is 40+15 = 55 degrees.\nHe then let the window open for 30/60 = 0\nThe temperature dropped by 2 degrees because the window was not open for more than 30\nThe temperature was 55-0 = 55 degrees.\nFinally, the window cooled the temperature by 3/1\nThe temperature dropped 2 degrees\nSo the final temperature is 55-(3/1)*30 = 55-90 = -35 degrees\n#### 55\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first thing to do is figure out how much the oven raised the temperature of the house over 3 hours\nIt means we must multiply 5\nIt took\n(2)\n3*5=15 degrees\nNow the house cools down\nIt cools down\n(2)\n30/6=5\n3\nIt cools down 5*2=10\nSo the final temperature is 40-15+10=35\n#### 35\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
