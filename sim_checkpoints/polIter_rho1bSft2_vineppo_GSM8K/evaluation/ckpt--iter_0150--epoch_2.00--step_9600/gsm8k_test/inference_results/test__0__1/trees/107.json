On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.\nHe watched 7-1-x (one hour episode on Monday, one hour and a half on Tuesday plus two 1-hour episodes on Friday);\nThus x is one-third of the amount of episodes: 7-1-x=3(the 30-minute episodes that are three parts of the 8\ntotal parts of the 7 total hours of TV\n7-3=4\nThus the answer is x=4-3=1\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -47.715019177645445, "len_probs": 132, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.\nHe watched 7-1-x (one hour episode on Monday, one hour and a half on Tuesday plus two 1-hour episodes on Friday);\nThus x is one-third of the amount of episodes: 7-1-x=3(the 30-minute episodes that are three parts of the 8\ntotal parts of the 7 total hours of TV\n7-3=4\nThus the answer is x=4-3=1\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.\nHe watched 1 * 2 (extra hours from Thursday,\nwhich he didn't watch\nbecause he didn't finish it on time))\n= 30\n episodes on Thursday.\nHe also watched 5\n= 7\n\nHe also watched 1 * 2\n= 3\n episodes on Friday.\nThus all the other numbers add up to 7\n- 3\n- 2\n+ 1\n+\n= 5\n5\n```\nSo the answer is 5 because 5\n#### 3\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nFrankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night.
