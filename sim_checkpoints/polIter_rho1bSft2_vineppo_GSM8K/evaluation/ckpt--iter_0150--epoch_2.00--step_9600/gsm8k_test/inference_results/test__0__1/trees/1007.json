They\u2019re ready to move on to another \u201ccommon\u201d unit of sticks.\nSo the answer is: 34 total sticks\n#### The \u201ccommon\u201d unit of sticks in the \u201c34\u201d expression is \u201cstick\u201d\n#### The friends have 34 sticks in total because the \u201cstick\u201d is a \u201ccommon\u201d unit in the \u201c34\u201d expression. They\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s a \u201ccommon\u201d unit of \u201csticks\u201d in \u201csticks and less\u201d. The \u201csticks\u201d is a unit in the expression, \u201c34 sticks\u201d.\n#### Another way to say that, in \u201c34\u201d sticks, there are 3 \u201csticks\u201d units and a \u201ccommon\u201d \u201cstick\u201d less\n#### The 3 \u201cstick\u201d units add up to 9 +\nThe \u201ccommon\u201d \u201cstick\u201d less\nSo the 9 red sticks + a \u201ccommon\u201d \u201cstick\u201d less\n#### Another way to say that, in \u201c34\u201d sticks, there are 9 red sticks, a \u201ccommon\u201d \u201cstick\u201d less, and the \u201cstick\u201d less than that \u201ccommon\u201d \u201cstick\u201d\n#### The friends have 34 sticks in total because 9 + \u201cstick\u201d units\nThe \u201cstick\u201d less than that \u201ccommon\u201d \u201cstick\u201d units in the \u201c34\u201d"}]}
