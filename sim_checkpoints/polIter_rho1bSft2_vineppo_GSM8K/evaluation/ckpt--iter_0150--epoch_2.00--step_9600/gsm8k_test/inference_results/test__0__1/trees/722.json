If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?\n\nSolution:\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the total cost to find the cost of fixing it yourself: $45\nThen multiply that number by 3 (because you need to buy three buckets of asphalt to fix it)\nThat would be 3 * $25 = $75.\nSo the final cost of the pothole after everything else would be fixed\n$45 + $75 = $120\n#### 120\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.643090333789587, "len_probs": 113, "answer": "\nFirst figure out how much the fine will cost: $120\nThen subtract that amount from the total cost to find the cost of fixing it yourself: $45\nThen multiply that number by 3 (because you need to buy three buckets of asphalt to fix it)\nThat would be 3 * $25 = $75.\nSo the final cost of the pothole after everything else would be fixed\n$45 + $75 = $120\n#### 120\n"}]}
