Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?\n\nSolution:\nBobby picks one less than Tony who can, or 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy picks twice as many as Bobby, or 2*5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two less than Kathy, or thus 2 less = 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nThus, all five can thus pick in an hour, 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 30 quarts.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.358070388436317, "len_probs": 122, "answer": "\nBobby picks one less than Tony who can, or 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy picks twice as many as Bobby, or 2*5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two less than Kathy, or thus 2 less = 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nThus, all five can thus pick in an hour, 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 30 quarts.\n#### 30\n"}, {"text": "\nKathy picks 6*2=12 quarts per hour more than Bobby.\nSo, Bobby can pick 6+12=18 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two less than Kathy, so he picks 18-2=16 quarts per hour.\nThus, the sum is 18+16+10 (from previous Tony, Bobby, and Kathy);\nSo, 18+16+10=44 quarts per hour.\n#### 44\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIt's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.
