If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.\n\nSolution:\nOn the second day, after the rain, the amount of water that was originally passing through the river in one day became half the amount of\nfour times\nthat amount. Twice the amount of the first day is 4000*2 = 8000 gallons,\nwhich means that on the third day this became +\n8000*1\n=> 8000\n+6000\n=> 14,000 gallons added on the third day,\nso the total is 4000+14000 = 1,8000 gallons.\n#### 18000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.49368737637997, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nOn the second day, after the rain, the amount of water that was originally passing through the river in one day became half the amount of\nfour times\nthat amount.
