She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?\n\nSolution:\nThe shorts cost $10 + an additional $5 = $15.\nThe shoes were half of $48, so they were $48/2 = $24.\nThe shopping cost $10 + $15 + $24 = $59.\nThe coupon added $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks = -$2\nSo the final cost: $59 - $2 = $57.
