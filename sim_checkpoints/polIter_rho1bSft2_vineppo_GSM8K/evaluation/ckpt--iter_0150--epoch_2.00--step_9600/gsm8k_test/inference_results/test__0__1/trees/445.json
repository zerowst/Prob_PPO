A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find how many miles his horse ran: 30 minutes at 32 miles/hour = 4\nThen multiply that number by the number of hours per mile his horse runs so he can find the total amount of miles he'll eat hay: 4 miles = 12\nThen multiply that amount by the horse's rate of consumption to find how many bails of hay it took: 12 / 0.5 = 24 bails.\nThen multiply the total amount of bails by the cost per bail to find the total cost: 24 bails * $3/bail = $72.\nNow let's find the total amount of money Michael has: 6 * $5 = $30.\nNow subtract Michael's purchase total from that total to find how much change he has: $30 - $72 = -$42.\n#### 42\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -39.642111886292696, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nFirst find how many miles his horse ran: 30 minutes at 32 miles/hour = 4\nThen multiply that number by the number of hours per mile his horse runs so he can find the total amount of miles he'll eat hay: 4 miles = 12\nThen multiply that amount by the horse's rate of consumption to find how many bails of hay it took: 12 / 0.5 = 24 bails.\nThen multiply the total amount of bails by the cost per bail to find the total cost: 24 bails * $3/bail = $72.\nNow let's find the total amount of money Michael has: 6 * $5 = $30.\nNow subtract Michael's purchase total from that total to find how much change he has: $30 - $72 = -$42.\n#### 42\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find how many miles his horse runs: 30 min * (60 sec/min)/(3600 sec/hr)=10\nThen multiply that by the horse's speed to find how far his horse runs on gas: 10 miles\nThen multiply that by the number of bails his horse needs to eat to get to the next mile (since it takes one mile to go up one bale): 10 miles/bale * 0.5 bails/mile = 5 bails.\nThen multiply the cost of each bail of hay to find how much the hay costs: $3/bail * 5 bails = $15.\nThen subtract that amount from the amount of money he has to find how much change he gets: $6 - $15 = -$9.
