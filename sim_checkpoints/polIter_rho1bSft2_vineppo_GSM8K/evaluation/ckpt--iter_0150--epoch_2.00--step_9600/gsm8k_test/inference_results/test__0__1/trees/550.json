How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the five notebooks is $1.50 x 5 = $7.5.\nThe cost of \"two pens\" is $0.25 x 2 = $0.5\nSo, the amount for all the two pens\n$7.5 + $0.5 = $8\nThe cost of \"one calculator\" is $12.\nSo, the amount for all the calculator\n$12\nSo, the total amount is $8 + $12 = $20.\nThere is an additional discount of 10% for the\ntotal amount of $20\n$20 x 10% = $2\nSo final amount Daniel needs to spend is $20 - $2 = $18.\n#### 18\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.62521106377244, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the five notebooks is $1.50 x 5 = $7.5.\nThe cost of \"two pens\" is $0.25 x 2 = $0.5\nSo, the amount for all the two pens\n$7.5 + $0.5 = $8\nThe cost of \"one calculator\" is $12.\nSo, the amount for all the calculator\n$12\nSo, the total amount is $8 + $12 = $20.\nThere is an additional discount of 10% for the\ntotal amount of $20\n$20 x 10% = $2\nSo final amount Daniel needs to spend is $20 - $2 = $18.\n#### 18\n"}, {"text": "\nThe initial cost of one notebook is $1.50, so five notebooks will cost = $1.50 x 5 = $7.50\nThe cost of two pens at $0.25\n= $0.25 x 2\n= $0.50\nThe cost of one calculator at $12\n= $12\nThe cost of one geometry set at $10\n= $10\nThe total total cost for five notebooks, two pens, one calculator and one geometry set at\n= $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20\nA 10% discount on $20, the discount amount is = $20 x 10% = $2\nThe amount that Daniel has to spend at the discounted price is = $20 - $2 = $18.\n#### 18\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA shop sells school supplies.
