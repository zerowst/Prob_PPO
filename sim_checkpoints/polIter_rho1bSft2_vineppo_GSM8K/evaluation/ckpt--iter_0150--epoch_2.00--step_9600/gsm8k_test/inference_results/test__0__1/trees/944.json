She has 6 yams which can be sold at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. If she sells everything, how much will she earn?\n\nSolution:\nThe total revenue from the 6 yams at $1.5 is 6 * $1.5 = $9.\nThe total revenue from the 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each is 10 * $2 = $20.\nThe total revenue from the 4 carrots at $1.25 each is 4 * $1.25 = $5.\nSo the total amount is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.\nThe total\nThe total she earned was a sum in a second that she didn\u2019t prepare. The other problem is that she didn\u2019t know how much to pay for her work.\nSo the answer is $34.\nThe answer is the sum of her work and her other problems: 34\nWhich means that the other problem she didn\u2019t prepare was that she didn\u2019t know how much work was required to earn her pay.\n#### 34\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -72.4101631641388, "len_probs": 212, "answer": "\nThe total revenue from the 6 yams at $1.5 is 6 * $1.5 = $9.\nThe total revenue from the 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each is 10 * $2 = $20.\nThe total revenue from the 4 carrots at $1.25 each is 4 * $1.25 = $5.\nSo the total amount is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.\nThe total\nThe total she earned was a sum in a second that she didn\u2019t prepare.
