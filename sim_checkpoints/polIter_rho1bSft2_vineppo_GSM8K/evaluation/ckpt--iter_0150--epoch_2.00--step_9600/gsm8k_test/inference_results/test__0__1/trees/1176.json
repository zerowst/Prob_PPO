Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used up 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece because he wrote more than\nhis goal amount, which means 1 - 0% = 0\nHe would have to recycle this piece of chalk:\n5 x 0.25 = 1\nSo he had to recycle this piece after 1 / (the # of days he would take to recycle\nthat much), which means\n(the # of days he would take to recycle that much) MOD 7\nSo the answer is 1\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.732225090265274, "len_probs": 126, "answer": "\nThe teacher used up 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece because he wrote more than\nhis goal amount, which means 1 - 0% = 0\nHe would have to recycle this piece of chalk:\n5 x 0.25 = 1\nSo he had to recycle this piece after 1 / (the # of days he would take to recycle\nthat much), which means\n(the # of days he would take to recycle that much) MOD 7\nSo the answer is 1\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nThe teacher wrote 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece, which is\n45/100 * 5 = 2.25 inches.\nThis means he was able to write on a piece that was\n1\ntotal\npieces\nand\n2\npieces\nleft\n(\n2\n>\n2\n)\nafter\nusing\nit\nfor\nwriting\nthese\ntwo\npieces\ntoday\nthat\nleft\n5\npieces\nin\ntotal\nso\nhe\nhas\nto\nrecycle\nby\nday\nn\n=\n5\npieces\ndiv\n20\npieces\nday\nn\n=\n2.5\npieces\nday\nn\n=\n5\n\u00f7\n2.5\n=\n2\ndays\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students.
