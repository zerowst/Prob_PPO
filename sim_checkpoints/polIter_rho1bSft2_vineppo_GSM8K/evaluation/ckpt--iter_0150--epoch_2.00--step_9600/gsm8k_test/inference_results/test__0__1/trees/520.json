It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?\n\nSolution:\nThe hat takes 2 skeins, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 2*3 = 6 skeins of wool.\nThe scarf takes 4 skeins per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 4*3 = 12 skeins of wool.\nThe sweater takes 12 skeins per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 12*3 = 36 skeins of wool.\nA pair of mittens requires 1 skein per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 1*3 = 3 skeins of wool.\nA pair of socks requires 2 skeins per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 2*3 = 6 skeins of wool.\nSo the total number of skeins of wool she needs is 6+12+36+3+6 = 59 skeins of wool. She will have to buy her grandmother a new set of knitting needles to go with her new set of wool because she only has 5 skeins in her set of 12. She needs to buy an additional skein because she only owns two\n#### 59\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -40.16290422528982, "len_probs": 270, "answer": "\nThe hat takes 2 skeins, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 2*3 = 6 skeins of wool.\nThe scarf takes 4 skeins per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 4*3 = 12 skeins of wool.\nThe sweater takes 12 skeins per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 12*3 = 36 skeins of wool.\nA pair of mittens requires 1 skein per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 1*3 = 3 skeins of wool.\nA pair of socks requires 2 skeins per, for 3 grandchildren, so she needs 2*3 = 6 skeins of wool.\nSo the total number of skeins of wool she needs is 6+12+36+3+6 = 59 skeins of wool.
