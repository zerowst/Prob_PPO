She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount spent was $4(each hamburger x five)), which equals $20.\nThe ten packs of potato cost $0.30 x ten = $3.\nThere were five cans\nThe five cans cost a total of\n$2 each five = $10.\nIn all the amount is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.\nThe change out is $50 - $33 = $17. Carly will get that amount of change back.\n#### 17\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -45.064745269715786, "len_probs": 122, "answer": "\nThe total amount spent was $4(each hamburger x five)), which equals $20.\nThe ten packs of potato cost $0.30 x ten = $3.\nThere were five cans\nThe five cans cost a total of\n$2 each five = $10.\nIn all the amount is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.\nThe change out is $50 - $33 = $17.
