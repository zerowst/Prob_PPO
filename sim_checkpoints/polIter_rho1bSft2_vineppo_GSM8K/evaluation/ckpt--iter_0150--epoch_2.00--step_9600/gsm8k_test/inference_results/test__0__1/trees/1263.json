On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of people present on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.\nThe total number of people on the first and the second\nday is 50 + 70 = 120.\nOn the third day, the number was twice 70\nSo, it was 2 * 70 = 140.\nSo the total from the first two days is 120\nThe total number of people are then 7\nAdd this with the number on the fourth day (the rest of the week)\nAnd you get 7\nSo the answer is 7\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.2921892888844, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nThe total number of people present on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.\nThe total number of people on the first and the second\nday is 50 + 70 = 120.\nOn the third day, the number was twice 70\nSo, it was 2 * 70 = 140.\nSo the total from the first two days is 120\nThe total number of people are then 7\nAdd this with the number on the fourth day (the rest of the week)\nAnd you get 7\nSo the answer is 7\n#### 7\n"}, {"text": "\nThe second day has 50*1\nThe third day has 50*2\nThe total on those days is\n50, 50+2,\n50*2\nSo, it was 100\nIf you know\nSo the answer is 400\n#### 400\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nConor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun.
