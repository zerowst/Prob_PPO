What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?\n\nSolution:\nThe larger box has a price per ounce of $4.80 / 30 ounces = $0.16 per ounce.\nThe smaller box has a price per ounce of $3.40 / 20 ounces = $0.17 per ounce.\nThe lower price per ounce is $0.17, so the box has the better value.\nConverting $0.17 to cents, we get 0.17 * 100 cents/dollar = 17 cents.\nThe smaller box has the better value.\n#### 17\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.438203677535057, "len_probs": 141, "answer": "\nThe larger box has a price per ounce of $4.80 / 30 ounces = $0.16 per ounce.\nThe smaller box has a price per ounce of $3.40 / 20 ounces = $0.17 per ounce.\nThe lower price per ounce is $0.17, so the box has the better value.\nConverting $0.17 to cents, we get 0.17 * 100 cents/dollar = 17 cents.\nThe smaller box has the better value.\n#### 17\n"}, {"text": "\nThe larger box costs $4.80 / 30 ounces = $0.16 per ounce.\nThe smaller box costs $3.40 / 20 ounces = $0.17 per ounce.\nThe price per ounce is $0.17 for the smaller box < $0.16 for the larger box\nThe lower price per ounce is $0.17.\nConverting $0.17 to cents, we get 17 cents per ounce.\n#### 17\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nOliver is trying to decide between two different sized boxes of macaroni and cheese.
