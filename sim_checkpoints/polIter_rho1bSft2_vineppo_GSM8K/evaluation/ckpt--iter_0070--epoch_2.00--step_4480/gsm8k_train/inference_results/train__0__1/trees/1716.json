Their teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a big science project that they and their society would benefit greatly from. They all paid the full amount except for 4 students, who paid half. How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThe original amount of money was $50 x 25 students = $1250.\n4 students paid only half, so they paid 1/2 x $50 = $25.\nThey paid a total of 4 students x $25 = $100.\nHence, the total amount paid was $100 + the amount paid by the other 21 students = $100 + $1250 - $100 = $1150.\nThe class was able to gather together $1150.\n#### 1150\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.294506639242172, "len_probs": 134, "answer": "\nThe original amount of money was $50 x 25 students = $1250.\n4 students paid only half, so they paid 1/2 x $50 = $25.\nThey paid a total of 4 students x $25 = $100.\nHence, the total amount paid was $100 + the amount paid by the other 21 students = $100 + $1250 - $100 = $1150.\nThe class was able to gather together $1150.\n#### 1150\n"}, {"text": "\nThe 21 students who paid the full amount is $50 x 21 = $1050.\nThe 4 students who paid half are $50 x (1/2) x 4 = $50 x 2 = $100.\nThe total amount of money from the 21 students is $1050 + $100 = $1150.\nThe class was able to gather the rest $25 x 4 (the number of students who didn't pay full amount) = $100.\nTherefore the total amount of money they were able to gather was $1150 - $100 = $1050.\n#### 1050\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIn Mary's class, there are 25 students.
