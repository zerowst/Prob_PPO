He orders a steak and egg meal for $16.  He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the meal before tip was 16+14 = $30.\nHis friend paid for 1/2 * $30 = $15.\nThe total cost after tip was $30, but before tip was $15, so the tip was $30-$15 = $15.\nJames paid $15, his friend paid $15, and the tip was $15 for a total of 15+15 = $30.\nJames and his friend split the bill, so they each paid $30/2 = $15.\nJames paid $15, his friend paid $15, and the tip was $15 for a total of 15+15 = $30.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.44455748051405, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nThe total cost of the meal before tip was 16+14 = $30.\nHis friend paid for 1/2 * $30 = $15.\nThe total cost after tip was $30, but before tip was $15, so the tip was $30-$15 = $15.\nJames paid $15, his friend paid $15, and the tip was $15 for a total of 15+15 = $30.\nJames and his friend split the bill, so they each paid $30/2 = $15.\nJames paid $15, his friend paid $15, and the tip was $15 for a total of 15+15 = $30.\n#### 30\n"}]}
