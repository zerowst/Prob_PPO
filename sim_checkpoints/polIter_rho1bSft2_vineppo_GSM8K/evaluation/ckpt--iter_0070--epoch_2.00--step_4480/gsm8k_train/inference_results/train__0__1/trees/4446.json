2 = 1\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 2 x (12 miles per hour) = 24\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait 1 hour because 1 x (12 miles per hour) = 12\nJanet has to wait", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -19.62360306829214, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nJanet's boat travels 60 miles in 1 hour because 30 x 1 = 30\nHer sister's boat travels 60 miles in 1 hour because 12 x 1 = 12\nJanet's boat will catch up with her sister after 3 hours because 60 / 30 = 2\nJanet will have to wait 2 hours for her sister to catch up because 3 -
