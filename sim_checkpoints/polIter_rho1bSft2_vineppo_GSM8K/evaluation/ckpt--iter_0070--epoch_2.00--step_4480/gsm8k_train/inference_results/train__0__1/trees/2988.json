The shelter already had half that number of cats. Two days later, three had been adopted. The next day, one of the cats had five kittens, and one person arrived to pick up one of the cats that was their missing pet. How many cats does the shelter have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe shelter took in 12 / 2 = 6 of the new cats.\nAfter 3 days, there were 12 - 3 + 6 = 11 cats.\nThen 6 + 5 (the 3 new cats) + 1 (the person's pet) = 12.\nThe shelter has now taken in 12 of the 12 new cats, so they have 12 - 12 = 0 cats now,\nSo the answer is 0\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.722836934030056, "len_probs": 123, "answer": "\nThe shelter took in 12 / 2 = 6 of the new cats.\nAfter 3 days, there were 12 - 3 + 6 = 11 cats.\nThen 6 + 5 (the 3 new cats) + 1 (the person's pet) = 12.\nThe shelter has now taken in 12 of the 12 new cats, so they have 12 - 12 = 0 cats now,\nSo the answer is 0\n#### 0\n"}]}
