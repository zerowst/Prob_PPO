centimeters each is 15 meters\nAfter 100 pieces are cut from the ribbon, the length of ribbon remaining is 36 meters.\nThe length of the ribbon remaining is 36 meters.\nThe length of ribbon remaining is 36 meters of ribbon.\n#### 36\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.560578148812056, "len_probs": 186, "answer": "\nThe total length cut from the ribbon is 100 x 15
