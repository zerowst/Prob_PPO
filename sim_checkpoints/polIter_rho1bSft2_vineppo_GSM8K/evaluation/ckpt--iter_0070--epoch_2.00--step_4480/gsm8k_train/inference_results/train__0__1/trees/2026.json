How much money does Hank donate in total?\n\nSolution:\nHank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds, so he donates 0.9 * $100 = $90 to the local homeless shelter.\nHank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds, so he donates 0.75 * $80 = $60 to the local homeless shelter.\nHank makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds, so he donates $50 to the local homeless shelter.\nAdding all the donations together, we get $90 + $60 + $50 = $200\nSo the total donation Hank makes is 200 dollars\n#### 200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.325015135109425, "len_probs": 187, "answer": "\nHank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds, so he donates 0.9 * $100 = $90 to the local homeless shelter.\nHank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds, so he donates 0.75 * $80 = $60 to the local homeless shelter.\nHank makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds, so he donates $50 to the local homeless shelter.\nAdding all the donations together, we get $90 + $60 + $50 = $200\nSo the total donation Hank makes is 200 dollars\n#### 200\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the carwash, Hank makes $100 and donates 90% of those proceeds, so he donates 0.9*$100 = $90\nIn the bake sale, Hank makes $80 and donates 75% of those proceeds, so he donates 0.75*$80 = $60\nIn mowing lawns, Hank makes $50 and donates 100% of those proceeds, so he donates $50\nAdding all the donations together we get, $90 + $60 + $50 = $200\nSo the total amount of money Hank donated is $200\n#### 200\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nHank is raising money for the local homeless shelter.
