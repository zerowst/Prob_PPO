All told, how much space will these trees take up in his yard?\n\nSolution:\nThe apple trees will be 10 feet wide so we need to multiply 2 trees by 10 feet each so we get 2*10 = 20 feet\nThe trees will be 12 feet apart so we need to multiply 2 trees by 12 feet each so we get 2*12 = 24 feet\nThe peach trees will be 12 feet wide so we need to multiply 2 trees by 12 feet each so we get 2*12 = 24 feet\nWe need to add the width of the apple trees, the distance between them, and the distance for the peach trees, so we need to add 20 feet + 24 feet + 24 feet = 68 feet\nAll together, Quinton\u2019s trees will be 4 trees * 68 feet = 272 feet\n#### 272\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.484966535121202, "len_probs": 197, "answer": "\nThe apple trees will be 10 feet wide so we need to multiply 2 trees by 10 feet each so we get 2*10 = 20 feet\nThe trees will be 12 feet apart so we need to multiply 2 trees by 12 feet each so we get 2*12 = 24 feet\nThe peach trees will be 12 feet wide so we need to multiply 2 trees by 12 feet each so we get 2*12 = 24 feet\nWe need to add the width of the apple trees, the distance between them, and the distance for the peach trees, so we need to add 20 feet + 24 feet + 24 feet = 68 feet\nAll together, Quinton\u2019s trees will be 4 trees * 68 feet = 272 feet\n#### 272\n"}, {"text": "\nQuinton wants to plant 2 apple trees that will be 10 feet wide each, so the apple trees will be 10 feet wide * 2 trees = 20 feet\nThe peach trees will be 12 feet wide, so the peach trees will be 12 feet wide * 2 trees = 24 feet\nThe apple and peach trees will be 10 feet + 12 feet = 22 feet wide\nThe peach trees are 15 feet apart, so the peach trees will be 24 feet + 15 feet = 39 feet\nThe apple trees will be 20 feet + 22 feet = 42 feet\nThe peach trees will be 15 feet + 15 feet = 30 feet\nThe apple and peach trees will be 42 feet + 30 feet = 72 feet\nIn total the trees will be 72 feet\n#### 72\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nQuinton is looking to add 4 fruit trees to his backyard.
