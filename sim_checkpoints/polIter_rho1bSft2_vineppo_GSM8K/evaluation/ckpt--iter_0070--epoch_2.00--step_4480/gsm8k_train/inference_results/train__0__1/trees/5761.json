How much does it cost to feed the turtles?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to figure out how many ounces of food the turtles need in total. We do this by multiplying the pounds of turtles by 1/2, since each pound has 1/2 pound of body weight: 30 pounds * (1/2 pound/1 pound) = 30/2 = 15 pounds\nNext, we multiply the total pounds of food by the amount of food per pound to find the total amount of food needed: 15 pounds * 1 ounce/15 ounces = 1 ounce\nNow we know that 15 ounces of food is the amount that Sylvie needs to feed her turtles.\nFinally, we divide this amount by the number of ounces per jar to find the number of jars she needs to buy: 1 ounce / 15 ounces/jar = 1/15 jars\nFinally, we multiply the number of jars by the cost per jar to find the total cost: $2/jar * (1/15 jars) = $0.08\n#### 0.08\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.49407701194286, "len_probs": 257, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to figure out how many ounces of food the turtles need in total.
