Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If we add all of the rooms together, we get 12 * 2 * 3 + 7 * 2 * 3 + kitchens = 72\nThis simplifies to 12 * 6 + 7 * 6 + kitchens = 72\nCombining like terms, we get 126 + 42 + kitchens = 72\nCombining like terms again, we get 168 + kitchens = 72\nSubtracting 168 from both sides of the equation, we get kitchens = 72 - 168\nThis simplifies to 72 - 168 = -96\nSince a kitchen cannot be negative, we add 96 to both sides of the equation to get the total number of kitchens, 96 + kitchens = 72\nThe total number of kitchens is 72\n#### 72\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.509055733680725, "len_probs": 240, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.
