There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nEach machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = $90.\nThere is 1 quarter = $0.25 and 1 dime = $0.10 so each machine holds 90 dollars in change = $2.25 + $0.10 = $2.35\nShe had $0.00 in quarters in the beginning and she has 80 quarters in change = 80 quarters\nShe had $0.00 in dimes in the beginning and she has 100 dimes in change = 100 dimes\nShe had a total of 80 quarters + 100 dimes = $180 in change\nShe has $2.35 per machine in change and she has $180 total in change so 180/2.35 = 80 machines\n#### 80\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.768357142806053, "len_probs": 203, "answer": "\nEach machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = $90.\nThere is 1 quarter = $0.25 and 1 dime = $0.10 so each machine holds 90 dollars in change = $2.25 + $0.10 = $2.35\nShe had $0.00 in quarters in the beginning and she has 80 quarters in change = 80 quarters\nShe had $0.00 in dimes in the beginning and she has 100 dimes in change = 100 dimes\nShe had a total of 80 quarters + 100 dimes = $180 in change\nShe has $2.35 per machine in change and she has $180 total in change so 180/2.35 = 80 machines\n#### 80\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of machines in the launderette.\nEach machine holds 80 quarters / 100 dimes = 0.8 quarters\nEach machine therefore holds 0.8x quarters.\nEach machine also holds 0.1x dimes.\nSo the total value of all the quarters is 0.8x quarters * $0.25/quadrant = $0.2x\nAnd the total value of all the dimes is 0.1x dimes * $0.1/dime = $0.01x\nSo the total value of all the change is $0.2x + $0.01x = $0.21x\nWe know from the problem that 0.21x = $90.\nTherefore, x = 90 / 0.21 = 400 machines.\n#### 400\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
