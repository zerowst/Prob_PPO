Kids scare 1/4 of them away by throwing stones, and 1/3 of the remaining birds decide to fly to McDonald's parking lot. How many seagulls are left?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the number of birds thrown away: 36 seagulls * (1/4) = 9 seagulls\nThen subtract this number from the starting number: 36 seagulls - 9 seagulls = 27 seagulls.\nThen divide this number in half since 27/2 = 13.5, which means 13 kids scared the birds away.\nThen find the number of birds that left the parking lot: 27 seagulls - 13 seagulls = 14 seagulls.\nThen add this number to the number that was left after the kids scared away some: 14 seagulls + 9 seagulls (kids scared away) = 23 seagulls.\n#### 23\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.887875072658062, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nFirst find the number of birds thrown away: 36 seagulls * (1/4) = 9 seagulls\nThen subtract this number from the starting number: 36 seagulls - 9 seagulls = 27 seagulls.\nThen divide this number in half since 27/2 = 13.5, which means 13 kids scared the birds away.\nThen find the number of birds that left the parking lot: 27 seagulls - 13 seagulls = 14 seagulls.\nThen add this number to the number that was left after the kids scared away some: 14 seagulls + 9 seagulls (kids scared away) = 23 seagulls.\n#### 23\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the number of birds thrown away: 36 seagulls * (1/4) = 9 seagulls\nThen subtract this number from the starting number: 36 seagulls - 9 seagulls = 27 seagulls.\nThen divide this number in half, since half of the number of birds are left: 27 seagulls / 2 = 13.5 seagulls.\nSince you can't have half a seagull, we round down to 13.\nThen subtract the number that decided to fly to McDonald's parking lot from the remaining number: 13 seagulls - 13 seagulls = 0 seagulls.\nThis means there were 0 seagulls left, because you can't have 0 left after the number is removed.\n#### 0\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThere are 36 seagulls on the roof of the Taco Bell.
