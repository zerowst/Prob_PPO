A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nAfter the reduction the price for each dinosaur model was $100 - 5% of $100 = $100 - $5 = $95.\nSo for all the models the school paid 6 * $95 = $570.\nThat's the total cost for the kindergarten and elementary libraries, but not for the other models.\nThe school bought 6 - 5 = 1 model for the science museum.\nThe price for that model was $100 - 5% of $100 = $100 - $5 = $95.\nSo the school paid $95 for that model.\nSo in total the school paid 570 + 95 = $665 for all the models.\n#### 665\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.57408458739519, "len_probs": 229, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nAfter the reduction the price for each dinosaur model was $100 - 5% of $100 = $100 - $5 = $95.\nSo for all the models the school paid 6 * $95 = $570.\nThat's the total cost for the kindergarten and elementary libraries, but not for the other models.\nThe school bought 6 - 5 = 1 model for the science museum.\nThe price for that model was $100 - 5% of $100 = $100 - $5 = $95.\nSo the school paid $95 for that model.\nSo in total the school paid 570 + 95 = $665 for all the models.\n#### 665\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nIn total the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe original price per model is $100.\nSo, the school should pay 100 * 6 = $600 in total.\nThere was a 5% reduction in price for each model, so the price was reduced by 5/100 * $100 = $5.\nSo, the price per model after the reduction is $100 - $5 = $95.\nThus the school paid $95 * 6 = $570 in total for the models.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
