This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers.\nOn the second day, he covered 1/2 * 50 kilometers = 25 kilometers.\nOn the first two days, he covered 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers.\nSo, he had to cover the remaining distance on the third day.\nTherefore, the total distance to be covered on the 3rd day = 50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers.\nEzekiel was left with 15 kilometers of the 50 kilometers distance to be covered on the 3rd day.\nSo he hiked 15 kilometers on the third day.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.476306825876236, "len_probs": 167, "answer": "\nOn the first day, Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers.\nOn the second day, he covered 1/2 * 50 kilometers = 25 kilometers.\nOn the first two days, he covered 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers.\nSo, he had to cover the remaining distance on the third day.\nTherefore, the total distance to be covered on the 3rd day = 50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers.\nEzekiel was left with 15 kilometers of the 50 kilometers distance to be covered on the 3rd day.\nSo he hiked 15 kilometers on the third day.\n#### 15\n"}]}
