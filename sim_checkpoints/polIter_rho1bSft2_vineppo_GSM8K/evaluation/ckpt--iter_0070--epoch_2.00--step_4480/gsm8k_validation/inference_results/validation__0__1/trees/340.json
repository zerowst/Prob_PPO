The 5 players, including Jess, play 5 rounds in which each player removes one block. In the sixth round, Jess's father goes first. He removes a block, causing the tower to almost fall. Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. How many blocks did the tower have before Jess's turn?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is 5 rounds * 1 block removed per player = 5 blocks.\nIn the sixth round, the tower fell almost without Jess's turn, so in the sixth round, there were 54 - 5 = 49 blocks.\nHowever, after Jess removed the last block, the tower fell, so Jess must have removed 49 - 1 = 48 blocks from the tower in the fifth round.\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.16857225447893, "len_probs": 113, "answer": "\nIn the first 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is 5 rounds * 1 block removed per player = 5 blocks.\nIn the sixth round, the tower fell almost without Jess's turn, so in the sixth round, there were 54 - 5 = 49 blocks.\nHowever, after Jess removed the last block, the tower fell, so Jess must have removed 49 - 1 = 48 blocks from the tower in the fifth round.\n#### 48\n"}]}
