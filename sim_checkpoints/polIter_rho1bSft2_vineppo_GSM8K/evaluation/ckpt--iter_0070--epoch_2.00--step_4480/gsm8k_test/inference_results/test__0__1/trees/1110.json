So, Soledad has 30 days to travel.\nShe wants to hike 125 miles per day.\nSo, she wants to hike 9300 miles in 30 days.\nSo, she wants to hike 30 days * 125 miles = 3,750 miles in total.\nSo, she has to hike 9,300 miles - 3,750 miles = 5,550 extra miles.\nSo, Soledad has to hike 5,550 miles / 3 = 1,850 miles per day to complete her journey.\nSo, she must hike 1,850 miles per day more per day to complete her journey.\n#### 1,850\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.036022916436195, "len_probs": 187, "answer": "\nJune has 30 days.
