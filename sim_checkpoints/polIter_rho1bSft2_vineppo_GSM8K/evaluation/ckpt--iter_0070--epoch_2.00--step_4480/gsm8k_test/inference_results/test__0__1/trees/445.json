If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how many miles his horse ran. We do this by multiplying 32 miles per hour by 0.5 hours (30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour), which gives us 16 miles.\nNext, we determine the cost of the hay by multiplying the number of miles by the cost per mile, which gives us 16 * $3 = $48.\nFinally, we subtract this amount from Michael's total funds, which gives us $48 - $4 (six $5 bills) = $40.\nTherefore, after buying the hay, Michael would have $40 in change.\n#### 40\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.63478846848011, "len_probs": 151, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how many miles his horse ran.
