They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran 15 * 2 = 30 yards.\nKelly ran 15 * 2 * (1 + 34) / 2 = 1050\nThe winner ran 1050 - 30 = 1020 yards\nThe loser ran 30 - 1020 = -980 yards\nThe winner runs 980 yards farther than the loser.\n#### 980\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.0025864392519, "len_probs": 107, "answer": "\nBlake ran 15 * 2 = 30 yards.\nKelly ran 15 * 2 * (1 + 34) / 2 = 1050\nThe winner ran 1050 - 30 = 1020 yards\nThe loser ran 30 - 1020 = -980 yards\nThe winner runs 980 yards farther than the loser.\n#### 980\n"}, {"text": "\nBlake ran 15 * 2 * 100 = 3,000 yards\nKelly ran 15 * 2 * 40 = 1,800 yards\nSo Kelly ran 1,800 - 3,000 + 1,800 = -1,000 yards\nTherefore Kelly was 1,000 yards behind\nSo the answer is 1,000\n#### 1,000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBlake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes.
