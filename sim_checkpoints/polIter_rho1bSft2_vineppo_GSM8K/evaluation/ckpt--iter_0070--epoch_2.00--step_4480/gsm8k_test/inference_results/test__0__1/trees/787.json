If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of smart and analog TVs sold is 40 x (1/4 + 1/8) = 40 x (3/8)\nThe total sales for smart and analog TVs is 40 x (3/8) = $15\nSo, they were able to sell the rest of the OLED TVs, which is the total number of TVs sold minus the number of smart and analog TVs sold,\n40 - 15 = $25 OLED TVs were sold that week.\nThe total number of OLED TVs sold was 25\nSo, the answer is 25.\nThis is the answer, but it should be a number, not a word. It should be \"25\".\n#### 25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.19378373399377, "len_probs": 172, "answer": "\nThe total number of smart and analog TVs sold is 40 x (1/4 + 1/8) = 40 x (3/8)\nThe total sales for smart and analog TVs is 40 x (3/8) = $15\nSo, they were able to sell the rest of the OLED TVs, which is the total number of TVs sold minus the number of smart and analog TVs sold,\n40 - 15 = $25 OLED TVs were sold that week.\nThe total number of OLED TVs sold was 25\nSo, the answer is 25.\nThis is the answer, but it should be a number, not a word.
