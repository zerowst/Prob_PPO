Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?\n\nSolution:\nBernadette\u2019s drive from her apartment takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s drive from his hotel, so it takes 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes to drive from Bernadette\u2019s hotel.\nBernadette should leave 5 minutes after Wayne to get to the theater before he arrives, since his drive takes 4 minutes.\nThis means Bernadette should leave 5 minutes after the drive starts from his hotel, which is 16 minutes after she arrives at her hotel, so she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.72537437081337, "len_probs": 145, "answer": "\nBernadette\u2019s drive from her apartment takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s drive from his hotel, so it takes 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes to drive from Bernadette\u2019s hotel.\nBernadette should leave 5 minutes after Wayne to get to the theater before he arrives, since his drive takes 4 minutes.\nThis means Bernadette should leave 5 minutes after the drive starts from his hotel, which is 16 minutes after she arrives at her hotel, so she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.\n#### 11\n"}, {"text": "\nBernadette\u2019s drive takes four times as long as Wayne\u2019s, so it takes 4 * 5 = 20 minutes to drive from Bernadette\u2019s hotel to the theater.\nThe total time for Wayne to get to the theater is his drive + his wait time + his departure time: 4 + 5 + 5 = 14\nThe total time for Bernadette to get to the theater is her drive + her wait time + her departure time: 20 + x + 5 = 20 + x + 5 = 20 + x\nBernadette should leave 14 - 20 = -6 minutes earlier than Wayne, which is the same as saying Wayne should leave 6 minutes later than Bernadette, which is the same as saying Wayne should leave at 20 + x - 6 = 20 + x + 4 = 20 + x\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film.
