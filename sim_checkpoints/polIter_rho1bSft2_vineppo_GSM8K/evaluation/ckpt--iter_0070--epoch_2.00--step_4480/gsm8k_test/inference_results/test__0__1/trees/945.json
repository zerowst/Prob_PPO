He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?\n\nSolution:\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nHe rested for 12/2=6 hours\nThe total time for the first part was 6\nSo the total time for the trip was 6+12=18\nHe was going to go 12*1/2=6 mph\nSo he went 12-6=6mph\nSo he took 18/6=3 hours\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.010509207844734, "len_probs": 102, "answer": "\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nHe rested for 12/2=6 hours\nThe total time for the first part was 6\nSo the total time for the trip was 6+12=18\nHe was going to go 12*1/2=6 mph\nSo he went 12-6=6mph\nSo he took 18/6=3 hours\n#### 3\n"}, {"text": "\nHe swam 2*0.6=1.2 miles\nSo he rested for 1.2/2=0.6 hours\nSo far he has been swimming for 1.2+0.6=1.8 hours\nThe total distance is 20, so he swam 20-1.8=18.2\nHe swam at 2 miles per hour for 1.8 hours so he swam 2*1.8=3.6\nHe swam 1.8, 3.6, 0.6, and 1.2 miles in that order, so his final distance was 1.8+3.6+0.6+1.2= 6\nIt took him 6 hours to get across the lake\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJames loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.
