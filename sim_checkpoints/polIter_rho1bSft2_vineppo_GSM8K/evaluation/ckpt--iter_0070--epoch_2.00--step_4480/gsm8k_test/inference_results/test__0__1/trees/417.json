How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 4 days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 kilometers = 800 kilometers.\nOn the next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, so he traveled 0.3 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next 3 days, he traveled 300 kilometers every day, so he traveled 3 * 300 kilometers = 900 kilometers.\nIn total, Tom traveled 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 900 kilometers = 1940 kilometers.\n#### 1,940\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.56209959089756, "len_probs": 172, "answer": "\nIn the first 4 days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 kilometers = 800 kilometers.\nOn the next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, so he traveled 0.3 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next 3 days, he traveled 300 kilometers every day, so he traveled 3 * 300 kilometers = 900 kilometers.\nIn total, Tom traveled 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 900 kilometers = 1940 kilometers.\n#### 1,940\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 kilometers = 800 kilometers.\nIn the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance over the first four days, so 2 * 800 * 0.3 = 480 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.\nThus, in total Tom traveled 800 + 480 + 2100 = 3380 kilometers.\n#### 3,380\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
