Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 8 days, Christina had 8 good days.\nIn the second 8 days, Christina had 8 bad days.\nSo in the first 16 days, Christina had 8 + 8 = 16 days\nThe next 3 days were good, so now Christina has 3 good days in a row.\nSo she has 3 days that are good for a total of 3 days\nIf Christina has 16 days in the first 8 days and 3 more in the next 3 days, she had 16 + 3 days = 19 days that were not good\nOut of her 30 days, 19 days had bad or neutral days, so she had 30-19 = 11 good days\n#### 11\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -34.60171711444855, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nIn the first 8 days, Christina had 8 good days.\nIn the second 8 days, Christina had 8 bad days.\nSo in the first 16 days, Christina had 8 + 8 = 16 days\nThe next 3 days were good, so now Christina has 3 good days in a row.\nSo she has 3 days that are good for a total of 3 days\nIf Christina has 16 days in the first 8 days and 3 more in the next 3 days, she had 16 + 3 days = 19 days that were not good\nOut of her 30 days, 19 days had bad or neutral days, so she had 30-19 = 11 good days\n#### 11\n"}]}
