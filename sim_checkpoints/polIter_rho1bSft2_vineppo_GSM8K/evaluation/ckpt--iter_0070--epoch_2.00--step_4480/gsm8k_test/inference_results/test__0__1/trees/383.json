She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie spent $18 to make enough supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade, so each pitcher costs $18 / 3 = $6.\nEach pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she makes an average of 4 cups/hour * 4 pitchers = 16 cups/hour.\nTherefore, she makes an average of $1 per cup, so her profit per hour is $1 per cup - $6 per pitcher = $1 per pitcher - $6 per pitcher = -$5 per pitcher.\nSince she has 3 pitchers, her total profit is -$5 per pitcher * 3 pitchers = -$15.\nTherefore, Millie's profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is -$15.\nThe profit is negative because she is making money from her lemonade stand, but she is not making any money from it.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.636731781065464, "len_probs": 218, "answer": "\nMillie spent $18 to make enough supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade, so each pitcher costs $18 / 3 = $6.\nEach pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she makes an average of 4 cups/hour * 4 pitchers = 16 cups/hour.\nTherefore, she makes an average of $1 per cup, so her profit per hour is $1 per cup - $6 per pitcher = $1 per pitcher - $6 per pitcher = -$5 per pitcher.\nSince she has 3 pitchers, her total profit is -$5 per pitcher * 3 pitchers = -$15.\nTherefore, Millie's profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is -$15.\nThe profit is negative because she is making money from her lemonade stand, but she is not making any money from it.\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nMillie spent a total of $18 to make enough supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade, so her cost per pitcher of lemonade is $18 / 3 pitchers = $6 per pitcher.\nEach pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so Millie makes an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open.\nMillie's profit per hour is the total amount of money she makes from selling lemonade minus the cost per pitcher of lemonade times the number of pitchers sold per hour.\nThe profit per hour is $1 per cup * 4 cups per hour - $6 per pitcher * the number of pitchers sold per hour.\nThe profit per hour is $4 - $6 per hour * the number of pitchers sold per hour.\nThe number of pitchers sold per hour is 12 cups per pitcher / the number of cups per pitcher sold per hour = 12 cups per pitcher / 4 cups per hour per pitcher = 3 hours of lemonade per hour.\nSo the profit per hour is $4 - $6 per hour * 3 hours of lemonade per hour = $4 - $18 per hour.\nThe profit per hour is $4 per hour.\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMillie decides to open a lemonade stand.
