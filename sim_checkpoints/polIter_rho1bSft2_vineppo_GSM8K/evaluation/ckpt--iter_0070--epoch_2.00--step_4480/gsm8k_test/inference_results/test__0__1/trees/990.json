How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees lower at low.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 4 * 3 = 12 degrees higher at high.\nTherefore, the air conditioner did not change the temperature by the amount it cooled or warmed it. It changed the temperature by 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.\nThus, after all, the temperature was 2 + 18 = 20 degrees higher than the starting temperature.\nThe final temperature was 20 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so the final temperature was 20.\n#### 20\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.499151483178139, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees lower at low.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room 4 * 3 = 12 degrees higher at high.\nTherefore, the air conditioner did not change the temperature by the amount it cooled or warmed it.
