The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?\n\nSolution:\nThe eldest started with $18 - $5 = $13.\nThe following day he added another $10, so his total was $13 + $10 = $23.\nHe spent $8, so he was left with $23 - $8 = $15.\nHe saved some more, so he tripled his remaining money.\n$15 * 3 = $45.\nHe is now left with the original $15, the money he saved $45, and the money he received from his parents.\n$15 + $45 = $60.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.167591363191605, "len_probs": 141, "answer": "\nThe eldest started with $18 - $5 = $13.\nThe following day he added another $10, so his total was $13 + $10 = $23.\nHe spent $8, so he was left with $23 - $8 = $15.\nHe saved some more, so he tripled his remaining money.\n$15 * 3 = $45.\nHe is now left with the original $15, the money he saved $45, and the money he received from his parents.\n$15 + $45 = $60.\n#### 60\n"}]}
