The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?\n\nSolution:\nIf 160 straws have been distributed among the small rodents, and each straw is given to a rat, then the total number of rats is 160 / 6 = 26 rats.\nIf 10 cages of hamsters are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, then the total number of straws given to the hamsters is 5 * 26 = 130.\nIf 20 straws have been distributed among the rabbits, and each straw is given to a rat, then the total number of rats is 20 / 5 = 4 rats.\nThus, the total number of rats in each cage is the same as the total number of rats in all the cages put together, 26 rats.\nThis is the same as 26 / 3 cages of rats.\nTherefore, there are 3 cages of rats.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.767251417040825, "len_probs": 225, "answer": "\nIf 160 straws have been distributed among the small rodents, and each straw is given to a rat, then the total number of rats is 160 / 6 = 26 rats.\nIf 10 cages of hamsters are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, then the total number of straws given to the hamsters is 5 * 26 = 130.\nIf 20 straws have been distributed among the rabbits, and each straw is given to a rat, then the total number of rats is 20 / 5 = 4 rats.\nThus, the total number of rats in each cage is the same as the total number of rats in all the cages put together, 26 rats.\nThis is the same as 26 / 3 cages of rats.\nTherefore, there are 3 cages of rats.\n#### 3\n"}, {"text": "\nIf 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats in each cage is 160 pieces / (6 pieces per rat) = 26 rats.\nIf 10 cages of hamsters are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straws given to the hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces.\nIf no straw is used anywhere else in the store, the remaining straws are 260 - 50 = 210 pieces.\nThese 210 pieces are distributed among the rats in the cages.\nIf 210 pieces of straw were given to the rats in the cages, each rat would receive 210 pieces / (26 rats) = 7 pieces per rat\nTherefore, there are 7 pieces per rat in each cage.\n#### 7\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRussell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents.
