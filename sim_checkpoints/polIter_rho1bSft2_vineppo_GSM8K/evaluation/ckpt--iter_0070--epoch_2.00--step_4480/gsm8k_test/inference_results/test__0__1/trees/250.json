There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 3 classes in the school. In the first class, there are 15 girls, so 15 / 20 * 3 = 4.\nIn the second class, there are 12 girls, so 12 / 20 * 3 = 3.\nSo in the first two classes, we have 4 + 3 = 7 students.\nThere are 50% boys in the school, so the boys are 100% - 50% = 50% of the total number of students.\nThe total number of students is the sum of the boys and girls in the three classes, so we have 50% * total students = boys\nWe know there are 7 students in the first two classes, so we can say 50% * total students = 7\nSo the total students are 7 / 0.5 = 14 students\nThe boys are 50% of that, so we have boys = 50% * total students = 0.5 * 14 = 7\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.599229030311108, "len_probs": 241, "answer": "\nThere are 3 classes in the school.
