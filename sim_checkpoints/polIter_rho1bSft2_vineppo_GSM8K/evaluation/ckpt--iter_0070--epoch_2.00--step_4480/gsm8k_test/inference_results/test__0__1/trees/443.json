44 = 1 hour and 25 minutes\nJames took a total of 1 hour and 25 minutes for the run\n#### 1 hour 25 minutes\n#### 1h 25m\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>\n#### 1\n</span>", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -23.05396043881774, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nIt took Jon 40 minutes for the swim, 10% faster is 40 * 0.1 = 4 minutes faster\nThe total time for the swim is 40 + 4 = 44\nThe total time for the bike ride is 1 hour and 20 minutes + 5 = 1 hour and 25 minutes\nThe total time for the run is 50 minutes\nThe total time for Jon is 44, 1 hour and 25 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run\nJames finishes the run in 50 + 1 hour and 25 minutes -
