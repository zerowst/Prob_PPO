One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.\n5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges are in one crate, so the total price is\n5 * $1 + 12 * $1 + 7 * $3 = $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\nSo the answer is: The price for such a crate is $38.\n#### 38\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.57970403879881, "len_probs": 144, "answer": "\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.\n5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges are in one crate, so the total price is\n5 * $1 + 12 * $1 + 7 * $3 = $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\nSo the answer is: The price for such a crate is $38.\n#### 38\n"}, {"text": "\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.\n5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges make up the whole crate.\nThe total cost of the bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.\nThe total cost of the apples is 12 * $1 = $12.\nThe total cost of the oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.\nSo, the total cost for all the fruits in one crate is $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\nSo, the price for a crate of fruit would be $38.\n#### 38\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
