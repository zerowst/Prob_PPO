depart from a station in opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other after 3 hours?\n\nSolution:\nThe first train is traveling 60 miles an hour, so in 3 hours it will travel 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.\nThe second train is traveling half the distance of the first train, so it's traveling 60 miles/hour * 0.5 = 30 miles/hour.\nIn 3 hours, the second train will travel 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles.\nCombining both trains' travel times, we have the total distance from their starting point: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.\nThus after 3 hours, the two trains are still 270 miles apart, because the distance they have traveled is the same as the distance between them.\n#### 270\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.54794752597809, "len_probs": 188, "answer": "\nThe first train is traveling 60 miles an hour, so in 3 hours it
