What's the total number of states in both countries together?\n\nSolution:\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, which means that the number of states in India is 1/2*x + 4, where x is the total number of states in the USA.\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation 1/2*x + 4 = y + 4\nIf we multiply everything by 2, we get 1*x + 8 = 2*y\nIf we subtract 8 from both sides, we get 1*x = 2*y - 8\nIf we divide both sides by 2, we get x = 2*(y - 4)\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries, which we call z, is equal to 2*(y - 4) + 4, so z = 2y - 12 + 4\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation z = 2y - 8\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries, which we call w, is equal to 2y - 8 + 4, so w = 2y - 4\nThe total number of states in both countries together is w + z, which is equal to 2y - 4 + 2y - 8 = 4y - 12\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries together is 4y - 12\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation 4y - 12 = the total number of states in both countries together\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation 4y - 12 = w + z\nIf we let w be the total number of states in both countries together, we can write the equation w = 4y - 12\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries together, which we call z, is equal to 4y - 12 + 4, so z = 4y - 8\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries together, which we call w, is equal to 4y - 8 + 4, so w = 4y - 4\nSo the answer is: w + z = 4y - 4 + 4y - 8 = 8y - 12\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.72648072242737, "len_probs": 545, "answer": "\nIndia has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, which means that the number of states in India is 1/2*x + 4, where x is the total number of states in the USA.\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation 1/2*x + 4 = y + 4\nIf we multiply everything by 2, we get 1*x + 8 = 2*y\nIf we subtract 8 from both sides, we get 1*x = 2*y - 8\nIf we divide both sides by 2, we get x = 2*(y - 4)\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries, which we call z, is equal to 2*(y - 4) + 4, so z = 2y - 12 + 4\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation z = 2y - 8\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries, which we call w, is equal to 2y - 8 + 4, so w = 2y - 4\nThe total number of states in both countries together is w + z, which is equal to 2y - 4 + 2y - 8 = 4y - 12\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries together is 4y - 12\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation 4y - 12 = the total number of states in both countries together\nIf we let y be the total number of states in the USA, we can write the equation 4y - 12 = w + z\nIf we let w be the total number of states in both countries together, we can write the equation w = 4y - 12\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries together, which we call z, is equal to 4y - 12 + 4, so z = 4y - 8\nThis means that the total number of states in both countries together, which we call w, is equal to 4y - 8 + 4, so w = 4y - 4\nSo the answer is: w + z = 4y - 4 + 4y - 8 = 8y - 12\n#### 8\n"}]}
