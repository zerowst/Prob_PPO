The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nSolution:\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200.\nFor the second venue, the cost is $25 per person.\nThe cost for food at the second venue is $5 per person.\nLet x be the number of guests.\nThe cost for the first venue is $200.\nThe cost for the second venue is $25x + $5x (for food).\nThe cost is equal to the first venue's cost when x = 0, and the second venue's cost is equal to the first venue's cost when x = 0.\nThus, $200 = $25x + $5x\nCombining like terms, $200 = $30x\nDividing both sides by 30, $x = 6.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.71246711537242, "len_probs": 190, "answer": "\nFor the first venue, the cost is $200.\nFor the second venue, the cost is $25 per person.\nThe cost for food at the second venue is $5 per person.\nLet x be the number of guests.\nThe cost for the first venue is $200.\nThe cost for the second venue is $25x + $5x (for food).\nThe cost is equal to the first venue's cost when x = 0, and the second venue's cost is equal to the first venue's cost when x = 0.\nThus, $200 = $25x + $5x\nCombining like terms, $200 = $30x\nDividing both sides by 30, $x = 6.\n#### 6\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of guests.\nThe first venue charges a flat fee of $200.\nThe second venue charges $25x + 5(x-cost of food) = $25x + 5x - $5(cost of food)\nWe set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:\n$200 = 25x + 5x - $5(cost of food)\n$200 = 30x - $5(cost of food)\n$200 + $5(cost of food) = 30x\n$5(cost of food) = 200\ncost of food = 40\n$200 + $40 = 25x\n$240 = 25x\nx = 9\n#### 9\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.
