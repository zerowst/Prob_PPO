How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday, he completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nOn Wednesday, he completed 1/4 * 98 = 24 problems.\nThus, after he completed the above, he was left with 100 - (12 + 36 + 24) = 38 problems.\nThus, after Thursday, he will be left with 38 problems to complete.\nThus, the total of all the problems he still has to do on Thursday is 38.\n#### 38\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.366074070334435, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nOn Monday, he completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday, he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nOn Wednesday, he completed 1/4 * 98 = 24 problems.\nThus, after he completed the above, he was left with 100 - (12 + 36 + 24) = 38 problems.\nThus, after Thursday, he will be left with 38 problems to complete.\nThus, the total of all the problems he still has to do on Thursday is 38.\n#### 38\n"}]}
