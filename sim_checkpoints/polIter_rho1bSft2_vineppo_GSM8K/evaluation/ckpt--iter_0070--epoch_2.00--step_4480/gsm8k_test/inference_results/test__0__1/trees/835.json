"len_probs": 196, "answer": "\nIf it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel, their combined rate is 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.\nEach turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so each turtle's rate is 1/2 * 6 hours per kangaroo = 3 hours per kangaroo.\nIf it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel, it takes 1 kangaroo 3*18/3 = 18 hours to travel the distance alone.\nTherefore, four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, will take 4*18 hours = 72 hours to travel the 18-hour distance.\nThe answer is 72.\n#### 72\n"}, {"text": "\nIf it takes 3 kangaroos 18
