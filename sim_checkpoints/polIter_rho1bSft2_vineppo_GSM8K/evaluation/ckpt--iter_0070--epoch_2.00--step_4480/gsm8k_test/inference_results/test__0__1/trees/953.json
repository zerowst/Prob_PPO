How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nKim went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 6 a.m. that day, so she slept for 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 6 hours and 20 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so she was awake for 2:38 - 2:15 = 13 minutes.\nShe went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her usual bedtime was 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.\nThat means she was awake for 6 hours and 20 minutes + 13 minutes + 5 minutes = 6 hours and 35 minutes\nSo she slept for 24 hours (6 hours + 35 minutes)\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.262975737452507, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nKim went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 6 a.m. that day, so she slept for 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 6 hours and 20 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so she was awake for 2:38 - 2:15 = 13 minutes.\nShe went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her usual bedtime was 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.\nThat means she was awake for 6 hours and 20 minutes + 13 minutes + 5 minutes = 6 hours and 35 minutes\nSo she slept for 24 hours (6 hours + 35 minutes)\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nKim went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 6 a.m. that day, so she was awake for 6 - 10 = 4 hours and 18 minutes.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, so she was awake for 2:38 - 2:15 = 13 minutes.\nShe woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she went to sleep at 10 p.m. - 5 minutes = 9:55 p.m.\nThat day she was awake for 13 minutes + 9:55 p.m. = 13:9:55 p.m.\nIn hours:minutes format, that day Kim slept 13 + 55/60 hours = 13.916666666666668 hours\nIn minutes:seconds 13.916666666666668 * 60 = 81.99999999999998 minutes\n#### 81.99999999999998\n#### 82\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room.
