30.\nThis is the correct answer because 30 is the correct answer to the question \"If there are 10 eggs in a basket, and there are twice as many eggs in a second basket, how many eggs are in both baskets put together?\".\nSo the answer is \"30\".\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.333865381777287, "len_probs": 158, "answer": "\nThere are 10 x 2 = 20 eggs
