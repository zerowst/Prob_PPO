Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?\n\nSolution:\nJoanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, meaning she gathered 30 * 0.5 = 15 from the shortest trees.\nShe gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as her sister did, so she gathered 2 * 30 = 60 from the tallest trees.\nHer sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as her sister did, so she gathered 3 * 15 = 45 from the shortest trees.\nCombined, Joanne and her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.\nSubtracting the apples Joanne and her sister gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the total they gathered together, 500, gives 500 - 105 = 395 apples gathered from the average trees.\nTherefore Joanne gathered 395 / 2 = 197.5 from the average trees, but since we can't have half an apple, we round it up to 198.\n#### 198\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.01170950382948, "len_probs": 267, "answer": "\nJoanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, meaning she gathered 30 * 0.5 = 15 from the shortest trees.\nShe gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as her sister did, so she gathered 2 * 30 = 60 from the tallest trees.\nHer sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as her sister did, so she gathered 3 * 15 = 45 from the shortest trees.\nCombined, Joanne and her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.\nSubtracting the apples Joanne and her sister gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the total they gathered together, 500, gives 500 - 105 = 395 apples gathered from the average trees.\nTherefore Joanne gathered 395 / 2 = 197.5 from the average trees, but since we can't have half an apple, we round it up to 198.\n#### 198\n"}, {"text": "\nJoanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, so her sister gathered 30 * 0.5 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.\nHer sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.\nHer sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.\nThe combined total of the apples Joanne and her sister gathered is 500, so we can set up the equation:\nJoanne\u2019s apples + Sister\u2019s apples = 500\nJoanne\u2019s apples + 30 + 60 + 45 + Average apples = 500\nJoanne\u2019s apples + Sister\u2019s apples = 500\nJoanne\u2019s apples + 95 + Average apples = 500\nJoanne\u2019s apples = 500 - 95 - Average apples\nJoanne\u2019s apples = 405 - Average apples\nWe know Joanne gathered 100 apples from the average trees, so 405 - Average apples = 100\nAverage apples = 405 - 100\nAverage apples = 305\n#### 305\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family\u2019s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.
