He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nThe number of red jelly beans is .9*30%*540=103\nThe actual number was 900, so he was 103-900=-81\nThe guess was 81 too low.\n#### 81\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.354703173041344, "len_probs": 86, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15=540 cubic inches\nThe number of red jelly beans is .9*30%*540=103\nThe actual number was 900, so he was 103-900=-81\nThe guess was 81 too low.\n#### 81\n"}]}
