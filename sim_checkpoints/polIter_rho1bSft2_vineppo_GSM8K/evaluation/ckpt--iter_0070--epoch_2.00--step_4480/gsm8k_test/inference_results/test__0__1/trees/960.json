They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?\n\nSolution:\nBy the end of the third day, the pirates dug ten + thirteen + eight = 23 holes.\nOn the fourth day, the pirates dug through a hole-filled chest to find a treasure, leaving them with a total of 4 * the initial 23 holes = 84 holes.\nThus, on the fourth day before finding the treasure, the pirates had been digging 84 - 23 = 61 holes.\n#### 61\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.840122669935226, "len_probs": 113, "answer": "\nBy the end of the third day, the pirates dug ten + thirteen + eight = 23 holes.\nOn the fourth day, the pirates dug through a hole-filled chest to find a treasure, leaving them with a total of 4 * the initial 23 holes = 84 holes.\nThus, on the fourth day before finding the treasure, the pirates had been digging 84 - 23 = 61 holes.\n#### 61\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first three days, the pirates dug ten + thirteen + eight = 21 holes.\nOn the fourth day, after finding the treasure, they dug 21 holes + 1 hole (the treasure chest) = 22 holes they dug on the fourth day.\nThere were 4 times as many holes as on the first day on the fourth day, so they dug 22 holes * (1/4) = 5.5 holes\nThe pirates dug on the fourth day 5.5 holes, but this doesn't make sense because they can't dig a fraction of a hole.\nIt's possible that they dug 5 holes instead of 5.5.\nSo the pirates dug 5 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.\n#### 5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map.
