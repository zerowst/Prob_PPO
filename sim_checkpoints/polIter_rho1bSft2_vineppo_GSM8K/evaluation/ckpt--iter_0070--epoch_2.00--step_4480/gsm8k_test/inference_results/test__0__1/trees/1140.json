If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine what 3 less than 6 potatoes is. We do this by subtracting 6 from 3, performing 3-6=-3.\nNext, we multiply this number by 6, performing 3*6=18, since -3*6=-18 is the result of 3 less than 6 potatoes.\nThis means that 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 18, so 3 less than that is 18-3=15.\nSince Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, we now know that Gomer ate the remaining amount of potatoes after subtracting 5 from 15, performing 15-5=10.\nTherefore Gomer ate 10 of the 3-less potatoes, or his answer is 10.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.384965635836124, "len_probs": 208, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine what 3 less than 6 potatoes is.
