We know he started on the 3rd floor, so we'll call that F.\nNext, we need to determine what floor Bill's destination floor is. The destination floor is 4 times Bill's starting floor plus 6, so the destination floor is 4F + 6.\nWe know that Bill is now on the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6, so we're going to call that F3.\nWe know that F3 is equal to the destination floor, so we can now say: F3 = 4F + 6\nWe can now plug in the value for F3 on the left side of the equation:\nF3 = 4F + 6\nF3 = 4(F) + 6\nSubtract 4F from each side:\nF3 - 4F = 6\nF - 4F = 6\n-3F = 6\nDivide both sides by -3:\nF = -2\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, we need to determine what floor Bill's starting floor was.
