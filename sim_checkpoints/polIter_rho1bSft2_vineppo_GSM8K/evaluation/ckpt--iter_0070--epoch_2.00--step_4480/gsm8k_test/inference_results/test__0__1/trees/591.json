The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?\n\nSolution:\nThe Dachshund weighed 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.\nThe Papillon weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.\nAnd the Mastiff weighed 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.\nSo the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThat's the answer, 220.\nThe Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThe Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThe Mastiff weighed the same as the 16th dog in the line.\nSo the answer is 16th dog's weight.\nThe 16th dog's weight is 220 pounds.\n#### 220\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.38213426619768, "len_probs": 170, "answer": "\nThe Dachshund weighed 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.\nThe Papillon weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.\nAnd the Mastiff weighed 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.\nSo the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThat's the answer, 220.\nThe Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThe Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThe Mastiff weighed the same as the 16th dog in the line.\nSo the answer is 16th dog's weight.\nThe 16th dog's weight is 220 pounds.\n#### 220\n"}]}
