of fence Sam has left over after they split it.\nAfter Sam and Harry split they have 100-x feet of fence because together they have 100 feet of fence.\nThey each get a number of feet equal to the total amount of fence they have divided by 2 because they are splitting it evenly.\nSam gets x/2 and Harry gets x/2+60 because he gets 60 more feet of fence than Sam.\nThe problem can be represented by the equation: x/2 + x/2 + 60 = 100\nCombining like terms, we get 1.5x + 60 = 100\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get 1.5x = 40\nDividing both sides by 1.5, we get x = 26.666666666666668\n####
