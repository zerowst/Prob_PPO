What will be the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Martin loses or gains per week from his breakfast choices. We begin by dividing the amount of weight lost per day from Cheerios by the number of days per week: 1.25 pounds/day / 7 days/week = 0.1785 pounds/week\nNext, we divide the amount of weight gained per day from donuts by the number of days per week: 1.75 pounds/day / 7 days/week = 0.25 pounds/week\nNow that we know the weight loss per week from Cheerios is 0.1785 pounds/week and the weight gain per week from donuts is 0.25 pounds/week, we can determine the net weight change for Martin per week: 0.25 pounds/week - 0.1785 pounds/week = 0.0715 pounds/week\nFinally, we multiply this weekly difference in weight loss by 5 to find the total difference over 5 weeks: 0.0715 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 0.3575 pounds\n#### 0.3575\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.434389680624008, "len_probs": 264, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Martin loses or gains per week from his breakfast choices.
