She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?\n\nSolution:\nShe paid $2 for a pack of grape gum, so she paid 2 / 2 = $1 for each of the gum she bought.\nShe paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum as she did for a pack of grape gum, so she paid 1 / 2 * $1 = $0.50 for each of the gum she bought.\nThe total she paid for the gum she bought was $7, so if she only paid $0.50 for the gum she got 4 - 2 = 2 packs of strawberry gum.\nThe 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $7 - $0.50 = $6.50.\nEach pack of strawberry gum cost $6.50 / 2 = $3.25\n#### 3.25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.75596894323826, "len_probs": 196, "answer": "\nShe paid $2 for a pack of grape gum, so she paid 2 / 2 = $1 for each of the gum she bought.\nShe paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum as she did for a pack of grape gum, so she paid 1 / 2 * $1 = $0.50 for each of the gum she bought.\nThe total she paid for the gum she bought was $7, so if she only paid $0.50 for the gum she got 4 - 2 = 2 packs of strawberry gum.\nThe 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $7 - $0.50 = $6.50.\nEach pack of strawberry gum cost $6.50 / 2 = $3.25\n#### 3.25\n"}, {"text": "\nShe paid $2 for two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry, so she got 2 * $2 = $4 for her strawberry gum.\nShe also paid $7 in all for all the gum she bought, so the gum she didn't buy was $7 - $4 = $3.\nShe bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the other gums, so it cost $3 / 2 = $1.5 for her green apple gum.\nEach pack of strawberry gum was $4 - $1.5 = $2.5\n#### 2.5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.
