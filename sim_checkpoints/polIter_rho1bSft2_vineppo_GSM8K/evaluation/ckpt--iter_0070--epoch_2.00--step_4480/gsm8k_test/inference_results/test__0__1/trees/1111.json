Problem:\nThere are currently 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store. Red balls cost $9, Blue balls cost $5 and green balls cost $3. How much will the store have received after all the balls are sold?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost for the red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.\nThe total cost for the blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.\nThe total cost for the green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.\nSo, the total cost for all the balls is $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.\nHence, the total amount the store will receive is $157.\nThus, the total amount of money the
