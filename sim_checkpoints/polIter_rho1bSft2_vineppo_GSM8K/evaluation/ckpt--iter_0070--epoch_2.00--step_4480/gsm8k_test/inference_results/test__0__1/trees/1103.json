How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nLet L be the number of large jellyfish, G be the number of green-colored large jellyfish, and B be the number of blue-colored large jellyfish. We know that G + B + L = the total number of jellyfish.\nWe know that L = 1/5 * the total number of jellyfish, and G = 1/3 * (L) = 1/3 * (1/5 * the total number of jellyfish) = 1/15 * the total number of jellyfish.\nThus, L + G + B = the total number of jellyfish.\nWe also know that 6 = B (since 6 jellyfish changed color from green to blue under UV light).\nSo, the equation is: L + G + 6 = the total number of jellyfish.\nWe can now substitute for G in terms of L and B:\nL + L/5 + 6 = the total number of jellyfish.\nCombining like terms, we get: (15L + 30) / 5 = the total number of jellyfish.\nWe multiply through by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 15L + 30 = 5 * the total number of jellyfish.\nWe know that 6 = B, so we can replace B with 6: 15L + 30 = 5 * the total number of jellyfish\nWe can now solve for the total number of jellyfish: 15L + 30 = 5 * the total number of jellyfish\nWe know that the total number of jellyfish is 60 (since 6 + 6 + L = 60), so we can now solve for L: 15L + 30 = 30 + 5L\nWe combine like terms: 10L = 30\nWe divide by 10: L = 3\nWe know that L = 3, so we can replace L with 3 in the equation L + G + B = the total number of jellyfish: 3 + G + 6 = the total number of jellyfish\nWe know that G + B = 30 - 6 (since 6 jellyfish changed color), so we can substitute: 3 + G + 6 = 30 - 6\nWe simplify: G + 9 = 24\nWe subtract 9 from both sides: G = 15\nWe know that G = 15, so we can replace G with 15 in the equation L + G + B = the total number of jellyfish: 3 + 15 + B = the total number of jellyfish\nWe know that B = 6, so we can replace B with 6 in the equation L + G + B = the total number of jellyfish: 3 + 15 + 6 = 24\nWe simplify: 24 = the total number of jellyfish\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.411561615765095, "len_probs": 674, "answer": "\nLet L be the number of large jellyfish, G be the number of green-colored large jellyfish, and B be the number of blue-colored large jellyfish.
