Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 flights = 1 flight.\nThis means the remaining 2 flights are split between flights to France and Germany, so each gets 2 flights / 2 = 1 flight.\nThe first plane takes a total of 1 + 1 = 2 flights per day.\nTherefore, the second plane (which flies exclusively to Poland) takes 2 / 2 = 1 flight per day.\nSo the first plane takes 2 flights on the same day that it goes to France, and the second one, which is the same amount of time.\nTherefore the first plane takes 2 flights on the same day that it goes to France, and the second one, which is the same amount of time.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.516490384936333, "len_probs": 179, "answer": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 flights = 1 flight.\nThis means the remaining 2 flights are split between flights to France and Germany, so each gets 2 flights / 2 = 1 flight.\nThe first plane takes a total of 1 + 1 = 2 flights per day.\nTherefore, the second plane (which flies exclusively to Poland) takes 2 / 2 = 1 flight per day.\nSo the first plane takes 2 flights on the same day that it goes to France, and the second one, which is the same amount of time.\nTherefore the first plane takes 2 flights on the same day that it goes to France, and the second one, which is the same amount of time.\n#### 2\n"}]}
