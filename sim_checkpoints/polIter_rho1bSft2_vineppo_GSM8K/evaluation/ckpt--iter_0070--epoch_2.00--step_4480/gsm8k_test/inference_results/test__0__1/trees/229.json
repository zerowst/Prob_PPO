Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.3 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn came back two weeks later, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were harvested, 84 x (3/4) = 63 melons were ready.\nSo, 84 - 63 = 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nThese 21 melons were the ones left after Ashlyn took home 36, so in the beginning there were 36 + 21 = 57.\nSo, there were 120 - 57 = 63 not ready melons to be harvested after the two weeks.\nSo, after Ashlyn came back from two weeks, 63 were ready melons.\n#### 63\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -33.72751231491566, "len_probs": 218, "answer": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.3 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn came back two weeks later, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were harvested, 84 x (3/4) = 63 melons were ready.\nSo, 84 - 63 = 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nThese 21 melons were the ones left after Ashlyn took home 36, so in the beginning there were 36 + 21 = 57.\nSo, there were 120 - 57 = 63 not ready melons to be harvested after the two weeks.\nSo, after Ashlyn came back from two weeks, 63 were ready melons.\n#### 63\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.3 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready, 84 x (3/4) = 63 melons were ready.\nSo, 84 - 63 = 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nThese 21 melons were the ones left after Ashlyn took home 3/4 of the remaining melons after two weeks.\nSo the total number of melons left is 21 + 36 = 57.\nTherefore, after the two weeks, 120 - 57 = 63 were not ready for harvest.\nThese 63 were the 120 - 63 = 57 melons left after Ashlyn took home 3/4 of the remaining melons after two weeks.\nSo, the 21 melons were the ones not ready after the two weeks.\n#### 21\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
