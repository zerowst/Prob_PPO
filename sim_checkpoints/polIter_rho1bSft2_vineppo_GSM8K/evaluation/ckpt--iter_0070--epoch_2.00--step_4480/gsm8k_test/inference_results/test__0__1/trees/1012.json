What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?\n\nSolution:\nLet P be the capacity of the power bank when it was fully charged.\nAfter 5 hours, Maria\u2019s power bank lost 9% of P per hour, so it lost 5*0.09P = 0.45P in total after 5 hours.\nAfter 3 more hours of charging, Maria\u2019s power bank lost another 7% of P per hour, so it lost 3*0.07P = 0.21P in total after 3 hours.\nTherefore the total loss of charge after Maria went out to the park was 0.45P + 0.21P = 0.66P\nThe final charge of the power bank was therefore P \u2013 0.66P = 0.34P\n#### 0.34P\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.97830756753683, "len_probs": 182, "answer": "\nLet P be the capacity of the power bank when it was fully charged.\nAfter 5 hours, Maria\u2019s power bank lost 9% of P per hour, so it lost 5*0.09P = 0.45P in total after 5 hours.\nAfter 3 more hours of charging, Maria\u2019s power bank lost another 7% of P per hour, so it lost 3*0.07P = 0.21P in total after 3 hours.\nTherefore the total loss of charge after Maria went out to the park was 0.45P + 0.21P = 0.66P\nThe final charge of the power bank was therefore P \u2013 0.66P = 0.34P\n#### 0.34P\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the initial charge of the power bank.\nAfter 5 hours, the battery lost 5 * 0.09 * x = 0.45x\nAfter another 3 hours, the battery lost an additional 3 * 0.07 * x = 0.21x\nSo the total loss was 0.45x + 0.21x = 0.66x\nThe charge remaining was x - 0.66x = 0.34x\nWe know that after 5 hours, the battery was 0.34x, which means that after the first 5 hours, the battery was at x = 0.34 * 5 = 17%\nThat means that the initial charge was 17%\n#### 17\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMaria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn\u2019t fully charged yet.
