For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?\n\nSolution:\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 * $60 = $360 in truck tires and 4 * $40 = $160 in car tires.\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 * $0 = $0 in car tires.\nThus, on Thursday, the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520 in revenue.\nOn Friday, the mechanic earned $0 + $0 = $0 in revenue.\nHence, the difference in revenue is $520 - $0 = $520.\nThe mechanic earned $520 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n#### 520\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.402205899357796, "len_probs": 169, "answer": "\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 * $60 = $360 in truck tires and 4 * $40 = $160 in car tires.\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 * $0 = $0 in car tires.\nThus, on Thursday, the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520 in revenue.\nOn Friday, the mechanic earned $0 + $0 = $0 in revenue.\nHence, the difference in revenue is $520 - $0 = $520.\nThe mechanic earned $520 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n#### 520\n"}, {"text": "\nThe mechanic earned $60/tire * 6 truck tires = $360 from truck tires.\nHe earned $40/tire * 4 car tires = $160 from car tires.\nOn Friday, he didn't repair any truck tires, so he didn't earn any revenue from trucks.\nOn Friday, he earned $160 from car tires.\nThus, on Friday, the mechanic earned $160 from car tires and $360 from truck tires for a total of $420, which is $160 more than the $360 he earned on Friday.\n#### 160\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.
