Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of beads needed to fill the space in the necklace. Since each gemstone is one inch long, and the space between each gemstone is filled with sterling silver beads, we need to determine the total space filled by the gemstones alone.\nEach necklace is 25 inches long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace, so the total space filled by the gemstones alone is 8 inches per necklace * 25 inches total = 200 inches.\nSince each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space by that number to determine the number of beads needed: 200 inches / 1/4 inch = 800 beads.\nTherefore, Katerina uses 800 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 800\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.325376212596893, "len_probs": 202, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of beads needed to fill the space in the necklace.
