When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.  What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?\n\nSolution:\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. His brother is currently 19 + (19 + 24) = 52 years old.\nEmil will be twice his brother's age when he is 24, so he will be 2 * 52 = 104.\nSince Emil is currently 19, he will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = 5 years.\nThus, when he is 24, Emil will be 104, so his dad's age will be 104 - 5 = 99.\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 99 + 52 = 151.\n#### 151\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.46070161089301, "len_probs": 182, "answer": "\nWhen Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
