If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?\n\nSolution:\nDuring the weekdays, Candy has 60 chairs rented per day. So in a week, she rents 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs.\nDuring the weekends, she has 100 chairs rented per day. So in a week, she rents 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs.\nIn one week, Candy rents 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.\nIn two 4-week months, there are 4*2 = 8 weeks.\nSo in 2 months, Candy will be able to rent her chairs out 8*500 = 4,000 chairs.\n#### 4,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.826289117336273, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nDuring the weekdays, Candy has 60 chairs rented per day.
