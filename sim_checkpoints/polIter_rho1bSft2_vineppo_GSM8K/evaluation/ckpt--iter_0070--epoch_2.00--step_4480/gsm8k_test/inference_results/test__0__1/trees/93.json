But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?\n\nSolution:\nLee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  This means that Lee's time was 38 seconds - 2 seconds = 36 seconds, which was Gerald's time.\nSo Gerald's time was 36 seconds = 400 meters / 36 seconds\nTherefore Gerald's speed was 400 meters / 36 seconds = 11.11 meters/second\nAfter his diet improvement, his speed is 10% faster, so his new speed is 11.11 meters/second * 1.1 = 12.32 meters/second\n#### 12.32\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.584041260182858, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nLee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.
