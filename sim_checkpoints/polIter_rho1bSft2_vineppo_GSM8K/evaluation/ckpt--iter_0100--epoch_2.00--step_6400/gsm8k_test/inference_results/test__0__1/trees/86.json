When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe second time it rang for 3 * 4 = 12 minutes.\nThe third time it rings, it is set to stop.\nSo the total number of times the alarm rang for in all is: 4th + 12 + 1 (for stop)\n4 + 12 + 1 = 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17\n#### 17.\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -32.011538341641426, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nThe second time it rang for 3 * 4 = 12 minutes.\nThe third time it rings, it is set to stop.\nSo the total number of times the alarm rang for in all is: 4th + 12 + 1 (for stop)\n4 + 12 + 1 = 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17.\n#### 17\n#### 17.\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17\n#### 17"}]}
