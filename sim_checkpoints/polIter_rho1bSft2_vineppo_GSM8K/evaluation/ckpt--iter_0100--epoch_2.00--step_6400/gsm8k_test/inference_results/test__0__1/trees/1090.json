And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?\n\nSolution:\nThe second child is 6 + (1/3) feet tall because 1 inch = 1/3 foot\nThe second child is 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 feet tall because there are 12 inches in 1 foot\nThe third child is 6.5 - 5 = 1.5 feet tall because 6.5 - (1 foot from the 2 inch increase)\nThe third child is 1.5 x 3 = 4 inches taller because there are 12 inches in 1 foot\nSo the fourth child is 4 + (1/3) feet = 4.66 feet\nSo the fourth child is 4.66 x 3 = 13.98 inches\nSo the fourth child is 14 inches tall because 13.98 is just a bit over 14\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.34991320595145, "len_probs": 198, "answer": "\nThe second child is 6 + (1/3) feet tall because 1 inch = 1/3 foot\nThe second child is 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 feet tall because there are 12 inches in 1 foot\nThe third child is 6.5 - 5 = 1.5 feet tall because 6.5 - (1 foot from the 2 inch increase)\nThe third child is 1.5 x 3 = 4 inches taller because there are 12 inches in 1 foot\nSo the fourth child is 4 + (1/3) feet = 4.66 feet\nSo the fourth child is 4.66 x 3 = 13.98 inches\nSo the fourth child is 14 inches tall because 13.98 is just a bit over 14\n#### 14\n"}, {"text": "\nThe second child is two inches taller than the first child, so he is 6 + 2 = 8 inches tall.\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so he is 8 - 5 = 3 inches tall.\nAnd the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so he is 3 + 3 = 6 inches tall.\nTherefore the fourth child is 6 inches tall.\nTherefore, the fourth child\u2019s height in inches is the same as that of the other child.\nThat is the answer to the question, the fourth child is the same as the other child\u2019s height, 6 inches.\nThat is the answer to the question, the fourth child\u2019s height is the same as the other child\u2019s height.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is the answer to the question.\n#### 6\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nCaroline has 4 children.
