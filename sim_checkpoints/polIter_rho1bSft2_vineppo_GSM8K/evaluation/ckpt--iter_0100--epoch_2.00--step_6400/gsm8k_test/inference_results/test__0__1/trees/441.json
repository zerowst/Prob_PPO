Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more beads do one sister have than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads?\n\nSolution:\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads * 20 = 20\nElizabeth bought 2 packs of clear beads * 20 = 40\nSo Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads * 20 = 60\nMargareth bought 4 packs of red beads * 20 = 80\nSo Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.\nThe difference is 140 - 60 = 80.\nThat is how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.\n#### 80.\n#### <\n#### <\n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n#### \n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -12.735007420182228, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nElizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads * 20 = 20\nElizabeth bought 2 packs of clear beads * 20 = 40\nSo Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.\nMargareth bought 3 packs of blue beads * 20 = 60\nMargareth bought 4 packs of red beads * 20 = 80\nSo Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.\nThe difference is 140 -
