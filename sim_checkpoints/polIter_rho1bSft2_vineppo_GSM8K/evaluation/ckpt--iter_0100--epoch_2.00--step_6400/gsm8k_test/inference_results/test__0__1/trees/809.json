He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?\n\nSolution:\nHe started off with 100 total candies and sold 150, so he sold 150 - 100 = 50 of the original order.\nHe ordered another 100 candies after he already had 100, so he ordered another 100.\nSo he has 50 of the original order and 100 more to sell: 50 + (total remaining to sell)\nThat means the total is 100 + Dale's remaining candy need\nThat is 100 + (Dale's total candy need)\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -36.45987591892481, "len_probs": 142, "answer": "\nHe started off with 100 total candies and sold 150, so he sold 150 - 100 = 50 of the original order.\nHe ordered another 100 candies after he already had 100, so he ordered another 100.\nSo he has 50 of the original order and 100 more to sell: 50 + (total remaining to sell)\nThat means the total is 100 + Dale's remaining candy need\nThat is 100 + (Dale's total candy need)\n#### 50\n"}]}
