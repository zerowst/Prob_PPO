He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?\n\nSolution:\nElliott took 1/2 * 10,000 = 5,000 steps to and from school.\nHe took another 1,000 steps for a short walk with his friend.\nSo he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far.\nHe took 2,000 steps at the end of his jog.\nTherefore, he took 2,000 left unfinished after doing his 1-mile run.\nSo the answer is 2,000 + (his other 1-mile run's steps), which is\nElliott's total steps for the jog: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n#### 2,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.985947221517563, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nElliott took 1/2 * 10,000 = 5,000 steps to and from school.\nHe took another 1,000 steps for a short walk with his friend.\nSo he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far.\nHe took 2,000 steps at the end of his jog.\nTherefore, he took 2,000 left unfinished after doing his 1-mile run.\nSo the answer is 2,000 + (his other 1-mile run's steps), which is\nElliott's total steps for the jog: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n#### 2,000\n"}, {"text": "\nElliott took half of his steps to and from school, so he took 10,000 / 2 = 5,000\nHe also took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\nSo Elliott took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\nElliott did not take 2,000 steps to his jog, because he had already passed 6,000 steps.\nTherefore 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps\nElliott took 4,000 of his steps during his jog.\nTo find the total, add the steps to the 4,000 he took during his jog to 6,000 (his other steps)\n6,000 + 4,000 = 10,000\nElliott took 10,000 steps in total during his jog.\n#### 4,000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.
