The car depreciates by $20000 x 0.21 = $4200 in each year.\nSo, the price of the car in the year 2010 can be calculated as:\n20000 - (20000 x 0.21) = $20000 - $4200 = 15800\nTherefore, the car's price in 2010 was $15800.\nSo, the car's price in 2010 was $15800.\nThe car\u2019s price in 2010 was $15800.\nThis is the solution to the problem:\nBen bought a car for $20000 in 2007.\nThe price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.\nThe car depreciation rate is constant, so we can use it to find the amount of depreciation each year.
