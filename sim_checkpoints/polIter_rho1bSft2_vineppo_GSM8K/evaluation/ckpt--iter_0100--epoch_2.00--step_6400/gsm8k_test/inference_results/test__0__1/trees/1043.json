If the whole population lives in these cities, how many people are there in South America?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 26 countries in South America and, in each country, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city. This means there are a total of 26 countries * 5 cities per country * 1000 people per city = 130,000 people in the whole population.\nTherefore the answer is 130,000 people in South America.\nThis is a good example of why you should not use a calculator when solving a problem. It is a good idea to understand how to do the calculations without a calculator, but you should not rely on that understanding to solve the problem correctly.\nIf you need to know how many people live in the whole population, you should use a calculator.\nIf you need to know how many more people live in the whole population than the number of people in the whole population, you can use a calculator to find the difference.\nThat is a good lesson in understanding the difference between what you can do with a calculator and what you can do without one.\n#### 130,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.89082217216492, "len_probs": 242, "answer": "\nThere are 26 countries in South America and, in each country, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.
