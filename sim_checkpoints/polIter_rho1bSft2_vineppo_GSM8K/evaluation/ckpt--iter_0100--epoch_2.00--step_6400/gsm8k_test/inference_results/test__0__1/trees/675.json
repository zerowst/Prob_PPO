How many toys in total does James need?\n\nSolution:\nThere are now 4 * (8 toys + more) total dogs in the shelter\nThere are 2 * (4 total dogs) more dogs than when James left\nThat means he needs to buy 8 + more toys\nSo after buying that he needed to buy 8 * 2 toys\nSo he needs a total of 4 * (8 toys + more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + more) toys\nSo he needs\n4 * (8 toys + 8 more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + 8 more) toys\nSo he needs\n4 * (8 toys + 8 more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + 8 more)\nSo the answer is 4 * (8 toys + 8 more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + 8 more) = 80 toys\n#### 80\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.48179941624403, "len_probs": 203, "answer": "\nThere are now 4 * (8 toys + more) total dogs in the shelter\nThere are 2 * (4 total dogs) more dogs than when James left\nThat means he needs to buy 8 + more toys\nSo after buying that he needed to buy 8 * 2 toys\nSo he needs a total of 4 * (8 toys + more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + more) toys\nSo he needs\n4 * (8 toys + 8 more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + 8 more) toys\nSo he needs\n4 * (8 toys + 8 more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + 8 more)\nSo the answer is 4 * (8 toys + 8 more) + 8 + 2 * (8 + 8 more) = 80 toys\n#### 80\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are now 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in the shelter\nThis is 12 / 4 = 3 dogs more than he originally had\nThis means he needs to buy 3 * 2 toys = 6 toys to\nGet the total amount of toys he needed for all the dogs\nHe needed before that because he didn't have enough toys to know he needed more toys to\nHe needed 3 + 6 = 9 toys to have the right amount for all the dogs\n#### 9\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJames needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter.
