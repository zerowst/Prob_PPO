The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches\nThe number of red jelly beans is .9*3*red = 9 red\nSo the total volume of the red jelly beans is 9*.15 = 13.5 cubic inches\nSo Tim guessed 540-90 =451\nThat means he was 451-540/540\nThat is .004\nSo he was .004 off.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.321708902716637, "len_probs": 126, "answer": "\nThe volume of the jar is 6*6*15 = 540 cubic inches\nThe number of red jelly beans is .9*3*red = 9 red\nSo the total volume of the red jelly beans is 9*.15 = 13.5 cubic inches\nSo Tim guessed 540-90 =451\nThat means he was 451-540/540\nThat is .004\nSo he was .004 off.\n#### 4\n"}]}
