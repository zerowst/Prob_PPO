What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?\n\nSolution:\nJane scored 15 + 18 = 33 points on the first two tests.\nThus, Jane needs to score 42 - 33 = 9 points on the third test to pass.\nThat is the minimum number of points Jane must get to pass for her third test.\nSo, she must score at least that, or 9 points, to pass on the third try.\nTherefore, the answer is that she must score at least that many points on her third test to pass:\nThat would be the minimum number of points she must score on that test to pass, or that she must score on that test to get 9 points.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the question: The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9.
