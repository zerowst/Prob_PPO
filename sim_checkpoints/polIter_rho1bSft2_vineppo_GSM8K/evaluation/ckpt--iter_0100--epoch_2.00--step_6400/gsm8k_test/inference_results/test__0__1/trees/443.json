It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?\n\nSolution:\nThe total time for Jon to complete his triathlon was the swim (40 minutes), the bike (1 hour and 20 minutes = 70 minutes), and the run (50 minutes) for a total of 40 + 70 + 50 = 160 minutes.\nIf he finished the swim 10% faster, that means he took 10% less time, which is 10/100 * 40 minutes = 4 minutes less.\nThat means he took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.\nThe bike took 1 hour and 20 minutes = 70 + 5 = 75 minutes\nIf he took 5 more minutes on the bike, he took 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.\nIf James took 10% less time for the run, that means he took 10% more time than 80 (Jon's time for run).\nThat means he took 80 * (1 + (10/100)) = 88 minutes\n#### 88\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.601909428834915, "len_probs": 254, "answer": "\nThe total time for Jon to complete his triathlon was the swim (40 minutes), the bike (1 hour and 20 minutes = 70 minutes), and the run (50 minutes) for a total of 40 + 70 + 50 = 160 minutes.\nIf he finished the swim 10% faster, that means he took 10% less time, which is 10/100 * 40 minutes = 4 minutes less.\nThat means he took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.\nThe bike took 1 hour and 20 minutes = 70 + 5 = 75 minutes\nIf he took 5 more minutes on the bike, he took 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.\nIf James took 10% less time for the run, that means he took 10% more time than 80 (Jon's time for run).\nThat means he took 80 * (1 + (10/100)) = 88 minutes\n#### 88\n"}, {"text": "\nThe time for the run is slower because it takes 50 minutes, which is 5 minutes more than the time it takes for Jon\u2019s run.\nIf it takes 50 minutes for the run, and it takes 10% less time for the swim, then it takes 50 / 1.1 = 45 minutes for the run\nSo James took 45 + 5 (for the bike) + 40 (for the swim)\nThus, James took 45 + 50 = 95\nSo the answer is 45 minutes to do the run\n#### 45\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJon runs a triathlon.
