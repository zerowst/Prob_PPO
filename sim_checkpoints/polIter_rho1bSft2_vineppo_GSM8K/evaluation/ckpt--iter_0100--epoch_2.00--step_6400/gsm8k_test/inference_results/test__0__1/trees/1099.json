The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?\n\nSolution:\nThe biggest slide takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to ride.\nThe second biggest slide takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to ride.\nTherefore, the biggest slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 more minutes to ride than the second biggest slide.\nThe answer is, it takes 2 more minutes to ride the biggest slide.
