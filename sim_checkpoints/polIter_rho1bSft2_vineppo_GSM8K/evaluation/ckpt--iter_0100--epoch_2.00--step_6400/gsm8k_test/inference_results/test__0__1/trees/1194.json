Calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have.\n\nSolution:\nEach whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, meaning each shark has 3*40=120 gallons of blood.\nIf a shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have (10*120)=1200 gallons of blood.\nThat is the total amount of blood the ten sharks in the sea have.\nSo, ten sharks in the sea have in total 1200gallons of blood.\nThat is the same as saying they\u2019re\nhaving a total of 1200\ngallons of
