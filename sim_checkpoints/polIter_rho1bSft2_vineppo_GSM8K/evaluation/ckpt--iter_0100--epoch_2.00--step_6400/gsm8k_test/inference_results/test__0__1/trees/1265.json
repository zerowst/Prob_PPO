For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?\n\nSolution:\nTim needs 6 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice, so he needs 6 * (4 gallons of lemonade)/1 = 24 lemons\nHe needs to make 1 extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, so he needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade\n1 gallon of lemonade is made from 1 gallon of lemon juice\nSo for the extra gallon, Tim needs to use 2 * (the amount of lemon juice)\nSo he needs 2 * (the amount of lemon juice) = the amount of lemons\nHe needs 2 * (24 lemons) = 48 lemons\n#### 48\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.099021159112453, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nTim needs 6 lemons to make 1 cup of lemon juice, so he needs 6 * (4 gallons of lemonade)/1 = 24 lemons\nHe needs to make 1 extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, so he needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade\n1 gallon of lemonade is made from 1 gallon of lemon juice\nSo for the extra gallon, Tim needs to use 2 * (the amount of lemon juice)\nSo he needs 2 * (the amount of lemon juice) = the amount of lemons\nHe needs 2 * (24 lemons) = 48 lemons\n#### 48\n"}, {"text": "\nTim needs 6 lemons for each gallon of lemonade, and he wants to make 4 gallons, so he needs 6*4 = 24 lemons.\nHis recipe calls for 1 cup of juice per lemon, so he needs 24 lemons * (1 cup of juice / 1 lemon) = 24 cups of juice.\nHis extra gallon is twice as tart as the other gallons, so it will have 2 * (2 gallons of lemonade / 3 gallons of lemonade per extra gallon)\nThis means it will have 2 * (2*4 - 4)\nWhich means it will have 2 * (8 - 4)\nWhich means it will have 2 * 4\nWhich means it will have 8 cups of lemonade\nSo he needs 8 cups of lemon juice to make 24 cups of lemonade\nSo he needs 8/2 = 4 lemons per gallon\n#### 4\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.
