She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?\n\nSolution:\nRose bought the eggs for 5 x $2.40 = $12.\nShe will be able to sell 12 x 3 = 36 eggs for $1.\nSo, Rose's profit will be $1 - (36/x)\n= (3 - (36/x))\n= 3 - (36/x)\n= 3 - (36/5)\n= (15 - 36)\n= -21.\nSo, Rose's profit is $21.\n#### 21.\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n#### \uff08\uff09\n####", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "length", "cot_probs": -30.534566272050142, "len_probs": 1024, "answer": "\nRose bought the eggs for 5 x $2.40 = $12.\nShe will be able to sell 12 x 3 = 36 eggs for $1.\nSo, Rose's profit will be $1 -
