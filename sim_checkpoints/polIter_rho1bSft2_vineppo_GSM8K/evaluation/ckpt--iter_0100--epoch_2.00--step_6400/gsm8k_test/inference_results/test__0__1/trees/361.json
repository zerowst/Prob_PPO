It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?\n\nSolution:\nThe total distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\nThe distance from the second city to the third city is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.\nSo, the total distance for the trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.\nThe total distance it travels per day is 3 * 300 miles = 900 miles.\nSo, the number of days between service is 900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05.\nThe answer is 0.05 is less than 1, so it needs to be rounded up to 1.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.625600397586823, "len_probs": 175, "answer": "\nThe total distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\nThe distance from the second city to the third city is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.\nSo, the total distance for the trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.\nThe total distance it travels per day is 3 * 300 miles = 900 miles.\nSo, the number of days between service is 900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05.\nThe answer is 0.05 is less than 1, so it needs to be rounded up to 1.\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total distance for the trip from the first city to the second city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\nThe distance from the third city to the first city is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.\nThe total distance for the trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.\nThe train goes between 3 trips a day, so it goes between services every 300 miles / 18,000 miles per service = 1/2 a service.\nTherefore, the number of days in between services the train goes between services is 18,000 miles / (1/2 service) = 36,000 service hours.\nSo it takes 36,000 / 3600 service hours per day = 10 days between services of this train.\n#### 10\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA train travels between 3 different cities.
