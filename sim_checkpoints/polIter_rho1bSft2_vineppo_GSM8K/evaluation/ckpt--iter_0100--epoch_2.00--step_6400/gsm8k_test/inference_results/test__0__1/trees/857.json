After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, doubling the previous amount of 4000 gallons. This means 4000 x 2 = 8000 gallons of water passes through the river.\nOn the second day, it is calculated that 8000 + x = the total amount of water\nOn the third day, it is calculated that 8000 + x + 6000 = the total amount of water\nCombining the first two days, it is calculated that 8000 + x = 14000 gallons of water passes through the river.\nTherefore 14000 + x + 6000 = the total amount of water\nCombining the first three days, it is calculated that 14000 + x = 20000 gallons of water passes through the river.\n#### 20000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.904491782188416, "len_probs": 213, "answer": "\nOn the first day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, doubling the previous amount of 4000 gallons.
