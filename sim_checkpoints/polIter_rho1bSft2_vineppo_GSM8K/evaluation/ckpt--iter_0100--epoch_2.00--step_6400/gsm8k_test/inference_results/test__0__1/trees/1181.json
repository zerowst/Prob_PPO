In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?\n\nSolution:\nLet C be Colin's current age.\nWendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, or 5*(C+7).\nIn 25 years, Colin will be C+25 and Wendy will be 5*(C+7)+25.\nSo we have that 5*(C+7)+25 = (1/3)(Wendy's age now).\nMultiplying through by 3, we get 3(5(C+7)+25)=Wendy's age now.\nMultiplying through, we get 15(C+7)+75=Wendy's age now.\nSo, Wendy's age is 75-15(C+7)=C+25.\nTherefore, Colin's current age is C+25-7 = C+18.\n#### 18\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.223924554884434, "len_probs": 209, "answer": "\nLet C be Colin's current age.\nWendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, or 5*(C+7).\nIn 25 years, Colin will be C+25 and Wendy will be 5*(C+7)+25.\nSo we have that 5*(C+7)+25 = (1/3)(Wendy's age now).\nMultiplying through by 3, we get 3(5(C+7)+25)=Wendy's age now.\nMultiplying through, we get 15(C+7)+75=Wendy's age now.\nSo, Wendy's age is 75-15(C+7)=C+25.\nTherefore, Colin's current age is C+25-7 = C+18.\n#### 18\n"}, {"text": "\nLet C be Wendy\u2019s current age.\nSince Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, we know that C + 7 = 5(Colin + 7).\nSo C = 5(Colin + 7)/8.\nAnd in 25 years, Colin will be Colin + 25, and Wendy will be 5(Colin + 7) + 25.\nSo in 25 years, Wendy\u2019s age will be 5(Colin + 7) + 25 + 7 = 5(Colin + 7) + 32.\nThis means that 5(Colin + 7)/8 = 5(Colin + 7) + 32.\nSo 5(Colin + 7) + 32 = 4(5(Colin + 7))\nSo 5(Colin + 7) + 32 = 20(Colin + 7)\nSo 15 = 5(Colin + 7)\nSo C = 3\n#### 3\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
