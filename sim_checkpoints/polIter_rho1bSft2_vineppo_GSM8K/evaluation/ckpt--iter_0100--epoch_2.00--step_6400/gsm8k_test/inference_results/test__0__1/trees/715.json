To find out the new price, we need to add 10% of $700 to $700.\n10% of $700 is: $700 * (10/100) = $70.\nSo, each computer was sold for: $700 + $70 = $770.\nTo find the total cost for all 500 computers, we need to multiply the price per computer by the total number of computers:\n$770/computer * 500 computers = $38,5000.\nThey paid this amount because they had $700 for each computer. They paid more money than what they had because they had to pay for the extra $10 per computer ($700 + $7 to account for the 10% increase over $700).\nSo the answer is, they paid $38,5000.\n#### 38,5000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.59912157803774, "len_probs": 248, "answer": "\nThe original price for each computer was $700, but they realized they were paying 10% more for each computer.
