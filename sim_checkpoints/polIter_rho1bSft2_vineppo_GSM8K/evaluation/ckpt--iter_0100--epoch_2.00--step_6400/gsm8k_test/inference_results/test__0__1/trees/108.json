He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make 2x.\nHe made 16 more than he thought he would last year (15 added to the number he baked each month).\nSo he baked x + 16.\nBut he only baked x * 2 (twice as many as he thought).\nSo he also has x * 2 = x + 16.\nThis gives 2x = x + 16\nThis gives 2x = x + 16\nThis gives 2x - x = 16\nThis gives x = 16.\n#### 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.185319993644953, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to make 2x.\nHe made 16 more than he thought he would last year (15 added to the number he baked each month).\nSo he baked x + 16.\nBut he only baked x * 2 (twice as many as he thought).\nSo he also has x * 2 = x + 16.\nThis gives 2x = x + 16\nThis gives 2x = x + 16\nThis gives 2x - x = 16\nThis gives x = 16.\n#### 16\n"}]}
