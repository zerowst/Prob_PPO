Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons.\nAfter she came back, 84 x 0.75 = 63 were ready for harvest.\nSo, 84 - 63 = 21 melons\nThat\u2019s the amount that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, is 84.\nSo, 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks of the harvest.\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.457196030765772, "len_probs": 152, "answer": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons.\nAfter she came back, 84 x 0.75 = 63 were ready for harvest.\nSo, 84 - 63 = 21 melons\nThat\u2019s the amount that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, is 84.\nSo, 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks of the harvest.\n#### 21\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nThe remaining 120 - 36 = 84 melons were still not ready to be harvested.\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready, 84 x (3/4) = 63 melons were ready.\nThere were 84 - 63 = 21 that were not ready to be harvested.\nTherefore the answer is 21.\nThat is the number of melons not ready for harvest after the two weeks.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the question: 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\nIt\u2019s 21.\n#### 21\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
