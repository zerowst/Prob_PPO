Each student started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. How many pencils were left?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 30 students in Marissa\u2019s class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils, so the class started with 30*10 = 300 pencils.\nAfter two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. So, the number of pencils that were used is 1/5*300 = 60.\nAt the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, 300-(60)= 240 remained.\nHence, the number of pencils left in the end was a number that is divisible by 3, so we can divide it by 3, 240/3 = 80.\n#### 80\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.685589239001274, "len_probs": 182, "answer": "\nThere are 30 students in Marissa\u2019s class.
