Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?\n\nSolution:\nThe Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, or 10*2=20 pounds.\nThe Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, or 20*1/4=5 pounds.\nAnd the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, or 44*5=220 pounds.\nSo, the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds.\nThat is what the Mastiff weighed, in ounces, for a total of 220 pounds.\nThat is because 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces.\nSo, the Mastiff weighed 220*16=3360 ounces.\nSo, the Mastiff weighed 3360.\nSo, the answer to the question is, it weighed 3360.\nSo, the
