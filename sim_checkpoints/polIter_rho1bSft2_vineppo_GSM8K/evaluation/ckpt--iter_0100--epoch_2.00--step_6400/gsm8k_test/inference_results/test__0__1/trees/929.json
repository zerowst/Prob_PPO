(60 more miles is a different way of saying a different quantity of miles.)\nThat is the answer to the problem as it is not a problem that you have to write out.\nIf you want to know how much more miles the bus went than the car, you can say that the bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo, the bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles. (60 more miles = 60, 60 less than the car\u2019s 240 miles.)\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem as it is a different way of saying the same thing.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 more miles than the car.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the problem: The bus went 60 miles more than the car\u2019s 240 miles.\nSo the answer is: The bus went 6"}]}
