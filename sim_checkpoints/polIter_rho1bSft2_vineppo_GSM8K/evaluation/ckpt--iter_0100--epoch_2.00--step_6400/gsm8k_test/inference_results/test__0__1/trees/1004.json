If Peter and Martha have totals of 64 and 56 chocolate bars respectively, how many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?\n\nSolution:\nPeter has a total of 64 chocolate bars divided over 4 boxes, so each box contains 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars.\nMartha has a total of 56 chocolate bars divided over 7 boxes, so each box contains 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars.\nTherefore, Peter has 16-8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\nThe answer is 8.\nThis problem is a good example of why it is difficult to solve problems with variables and constants. It is difficult to find a general solution because the numbers are not equal.\nHowever, the solution above is the best we can do with the given information.\nWe can also solve this problem by setting up an equation.\nLet x be the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and Martha. We can write the equation 4x + 7x = 64 and 4x + 7x = 56.\nThe solution to this equation is the same as the solution to 4x + 7x = 64 and 4x + 7x = 56, which is x = 8.\nThis is the answer to the problem: Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -51.161874901503325, "len_probs": 296, "answer": "\nPeter has a total of 64 chocolate bars divided over 4 boxes, so each box contains 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars.\nMartha has a total of 56 chocolate bars divided over 7 boxes, so each box contains 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars.\nTherefore, Peter has 16-8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.\nThe answer is 8.\nThis problem is a good example of why it is difficult to solve problems with variables and constants.
