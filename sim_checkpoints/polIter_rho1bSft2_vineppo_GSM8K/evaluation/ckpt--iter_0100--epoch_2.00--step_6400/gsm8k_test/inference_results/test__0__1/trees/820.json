She also walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, to Hollock valley shores. Calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes.\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, she walked for 8*60 = 480 minutes.\nOn the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is 480/2 = 240 minutes.\nTo find the total time Sandy walked in the two days, we add the time from the first day to the total we get now: 480 (first day) + 240 (second day) = 720\nFinally, we add this total number of minutes to the time Sandy walked on the first day: 720 (total) + 480 (first day) = 1200\nSandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 1200 minutes that, in minutes, is the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days.\n#### 1200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -35.666701935231686, "len_probs": 220, "answer": "\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
