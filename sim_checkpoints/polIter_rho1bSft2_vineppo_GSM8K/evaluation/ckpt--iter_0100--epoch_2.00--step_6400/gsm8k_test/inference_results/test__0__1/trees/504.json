If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?\n\nSolution:\nShe paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked.\nShe paid $2 / (half)\nThat means she paid 2 / (1/2) = $4 for the grape gum\nShe paid a total of $7, so the strawberry gum, green apple and apple gum costed $7 - $4 = $3\nShe paid half as much for the green apple gum as the $3 she paid for the apple gum, so it cost 3 / (half)\nThat means it cost 3 / (1/2) = $6 per pack of apple gum\nEach pack of strawberry gum cost was\n$6 - (half) the cost of the other gums.\nSo the answer is $6\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.446689933538437, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nShe paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked.\nShe paid $2 / (half)\nThat means she paid 2 / (1/2) = $4 for the grape gum\nShe paid a total of $7, so the strawberry gum, green apple and apple gum costed $7 - $4 = $3\nShe paid half as much for the green apple gum as the $3 she paid for the apple gum, so it cost 3 / (half)\nThat means it cost 3 / (1/2) = $6 per pack of apple gum\nEach pack of strawberry gum cost was\n$6 - (half) the cost of the other gums.\nSo the answer is $6\n#### 6\n"}, {"text": "\nShe paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked, so each grape gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.\nShe paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, so it cost 2 / 2 * $3, which is $3.\nThe four packs cost 2 + $3 = $5 in total for the grape and green apple gums.\nThe strawberry gum packs cost 7 - (the price of the grape and green apple gums)\nSo 4 (total cost of the strawberry gums) = $7 - (the price of the grape and green apple gums)\nThis means 4 * x = 7\nSo each strawberry gum cost x = 7 / 4\n#### 1\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.
