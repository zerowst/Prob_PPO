A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nA third of the jellyfish are large and change color, so they are 1/5 * jellyfish = 3 jellyfish.\nA quarter of the jellyfish are small and don't change color, so they are 1/4 * jellyfish = 4 jellyfish.\nThe rest of the jellyfish are small and don't change color, so they are 3 + 4 = 7 jellyfish.\nThe jellyfish tank has 7 + the jellyfish that are changed color = total jellyfish\nThere are 7 jellyfish in the tank + 6 jellyfish that changed color = 13 jellyfish.\nThere were 2 jellyfish in the tank at the start, so they are 2 + 7 = 9 jellyfish.\n#### 9\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.18493378162384, "len_probs": 186, "answer": "\nA third of the jellyfish are large and change color, so they are 1/5 * jellyfish = 3 jellyfish.\nA quarter of the jellyfish are small and don't change color, so they are 1/4 * jellyfish = 4 jellyfish.\nThe rest of the jellyfish are small and don't change color, so they are 3 + 4 = 7 jellyfish.\nThe jellyfish tank has 7 + the jellyfish that are changed color = total jellyfish\nThere are 7 jellyfish in the tank + 6 jellyfish that changed color = 13 jellyfish.\nThere were 2 jellyfish in the tank at the start, so they are 2 + 7 = 9 jellyfish.\n#### 9\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 6 * (large * (1/3)) = 2 jellyfish that change color.\nThere are 6 + (large * (1/3)) = 2 jellyfish that are not changing color.\nThere are (large * (1/5)) = 4 large jellyfish.\nThere are (large * (1/5)) * (1 + (large * (1/3))))\nThere are (4 * (1 + (large * (1/3)))) = 12 jellyfish in the tank.\n#### 12\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it.
