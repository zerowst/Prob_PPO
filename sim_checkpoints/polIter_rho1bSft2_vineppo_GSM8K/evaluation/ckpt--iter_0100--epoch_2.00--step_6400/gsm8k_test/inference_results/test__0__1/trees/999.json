6)\nThe size of each adult's slice is the same as the size of each kid's slice, so each adult gets a slice that is 100% of the watermelon.\n#### 100\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?\n\nSolution:\nEach adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so we can say that each adult gets a slice that is 2 * (the size of each kid's slice), which means each adult gets a total of (2 * the size of each kid's slice)\nThe total size of the slices for each adult is: 2 * (the size of each kid's slice)\nThe total size of the slices for the 4 kids is: 4 * (the size of each kid's slice)\nSo, the total size for all the slices is: (2 * the size of each kid's slice) + (4 * the size of each kid's slice)\nThis total is then divided among the 6 people in the family (2 adults + 4 kids), so we can multiply:\n(2 * the size of each kid's slice) + (4 * the size of each kid's slice) = (6 total slices)\n(2a + 4b = 6)\nEach adult gets (2 * the size of each kid's slice) = (the size of each kid's slice)\nSo, each adult gets 100% of the slices, which is: (the size of each kid's slice)\nSo, the adults get a total of 100%\nThis means that the adults get the same amount of the watermelon, because:\n(the size of each kid's slice)\nSo:\n(2a + 4b = 6)\n(2 * the size of each kid's slice) + (4 * the size of each kid's slice) = (6 total slices)\n(6 total slices)\n(2a + 4b = 6)\nThe size of each adult's slice is the same as the size of each kid's slice, so each adult gets a slice that is 100% of the watermelon.\n#### 100\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -68.07405004277825, "len_probs": 448, "answer": "\nEach adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so we can say that each adult gets a slice that is 2 * (the size of each kid's slice), which means each adult gets a total of (2 * the size of each kid's slice)\nThe total size of the slices for each adult is: 2 * (the size of each kid's slice)\nThe total size of the slices for the 4 kids is: 4 * (the size of each kid's slice)\nSo, the total size for all the slices is: (2 * the size of each kid's slice) + (4 * the size of each kid's slice)\nThis total is then divided among the 6 people in the family (2 adults + 4 kids), so we can multiply:\n(2 * the size of each kid's slice) + (4 * the size of each kid's slice) = (6 total slices)\n(2a + 4b = 6)\nEach adult gets (2 * the size of each kid's slice) = (the size of each kid's slice)\nSo, each adult gets 100% of the slices, which is: (the size of each kid's slice)\nSo, the adults get a total of 100%\nThis means that the adults get the same amount of the watermelon, because:\n(the size of each kid's slice)\nSo:\n(2a + 4b = 6)\n(2 * the size of each kid's slice) + (4 * the size of each kid's slice) = (6 total slices)\n(6 total slices)\n(2a + 4b = 6)\nThe size of each adult's slice is the same as the size of each kid's slice, so each adult gets a slice that is 100% of the watermelon.\n#### 100\n"}]}
