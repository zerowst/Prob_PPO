How many medals have been given out for counting?\n\nSolution:\nIzzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\nTogether, they have 17 + 22 = 39 medals.\nTherefore you have 10 times less than the 39 medals that they have, so you have 10 * (medals that were counted for).\nThis will be the total of the medals that were counted for, so you will be able to find out how many the superstar counter has won for counting super fast had before.\nThat is 10 * (medals that were counted for) = 10 * (39 medals)\nSo the superstar counter has won 10 * (medals that were counted for) a total of 39 medals,\nwhich means he has been awarded the 10 * 39\n#### 39\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -37.536389388144016, "len_probs": 189, "answer": "\nIzzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\nTogether, they have 17 + 22 = 39 medals.\nTherefore you have 10 times less than the 39 medals that they have, so you have 10 * (medals that were counted for).\nThis will be the total of the medals that were counted for, so you will be able to find out how many the superstar counter has won for counting super fast had before.\nThat is 10 * (medals that were counted for) = 10 * (39 medals)\nSo the superstar counter has won 10 * (medals that were counted for) a total of 39 medals,\nwhich means he has been awarded the 10 * 39\n#### 39\n"}, {"text": "\nIzzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\nTogether, they have 10 times less medals than the total amount, so if we add the medals from Ali and Izzy we get:\n22 + 17 + (Ali's total) = (total amount of medals)\n39 + (Ali's total) = (total amount of medals)\nAli's total = 10 * (total amount of medals) - (they have 10 times less)\nAli's total = (10 * total amount of medals) - 10\nAli's total = (10 * (total amount of medals)) - 10\n39 + (Ali's total) = (10 * (total amount of medals)) - 10\n39 + 17 = 10 * (total amount of medals) - 10\n22 = 10 * (total amount of medals) - 10\n22 + 10 = 10 * (total amount of medals)\n32 = 10 * (total amount of medals)\n32 / 10 = (total amount of medals)\n3.2 = (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >\n#### 32\n#### 32\n#### >\n#### (total amount of medals)\n#### 3.2\n#### <\n#### <\n#### 10\n#### 10\n#### >", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAli is a superstar counter.
