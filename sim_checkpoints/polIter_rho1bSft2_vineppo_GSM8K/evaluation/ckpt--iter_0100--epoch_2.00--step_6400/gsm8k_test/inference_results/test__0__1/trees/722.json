If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total cost of repairing the pothole: $450 + $120 (fine)\nThen find the total cost of buying the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75\nNow find how much more Ron saves by repairing it himself: $75 - $30 (for asphalt)\nSo the total amount Ron saves is $45 (fine for repair) + $30 (asphalt) = $75\nSo he saves $75 in total.\n#### 75\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.39255078881979, "len_probs": 129, "answer": "\nFirst find the total cost of repairing the pothole: $450 + $120 (fine)\nThen find the total cost of buying the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75\nNow find how much more Ron saves by repairing it himself: $75 - $30 (for asphalt)\nSo the total amount Ron saves is $45 (fine for repair) + $30 (asphalt) = $75\nSo he saves $75 in total.\n#### 75\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the total cost of the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75.\nThen add that to the cost of the fine to find Ron\u2019s net savings: $75 + $120 = $195.\nRon saved $195 from that $450 cost of damage.\nSo the answer is, Ron saved, $450, - $195, $195.\n#### 195.\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 195\n#### 195\n</span>\n#### 195\n#### 195\n#### 450\n#### 1", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nRon is fed up with the pothole in front of his house.
