and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?\n\nSolution:\nCarlos will pay $30 x 3 = $90 for his canoe rental.\nBenji will pay $18 x 5 = $90 for his raft rental.\nSo, the total cost for both of them is $90 + $90 = $180.\nThus the total amount of the bill for both of them is $180.\nTherefore, the total amount of the bill for the rentals is $180.\nTherefore, you can use the word \u201cthat\u201d to express what the total amount of the bill for the rentals is.\nSo, the correct answer is \u201c$180\u201d.\nSo, the
