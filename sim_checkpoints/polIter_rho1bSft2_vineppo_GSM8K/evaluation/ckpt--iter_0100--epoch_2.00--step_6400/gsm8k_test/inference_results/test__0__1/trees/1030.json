What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\n\nSolution:\nThere's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher not collecting the homework, and a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of getting his assignment extended. If those two events are independent, the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework is: (0.5 * 0.4 + 0.4 * 0.2) * 0.2 = 0.16\n#### 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.969414949417114, "len_probs": 120, "answer": "\nThere's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher not collecting the homework, and a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension.
