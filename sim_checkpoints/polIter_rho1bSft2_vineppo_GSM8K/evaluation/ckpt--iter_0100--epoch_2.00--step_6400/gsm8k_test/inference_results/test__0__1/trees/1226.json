A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a pedicure is $40.\nBoth the manicure and pedicure cost $35 + $40 = $75.\nA salon offers a 20% discount on the total cost of $75, which is 20/100 x $75 = $15.\nSo, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.\nKaren would like to add nail art to her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. She has 2 fingers, so she would pay $3 x 2 = $6 in total for the nail art.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60 + $6 = $66 in total for her manicure, pedicure, and nail art.\n#### 66\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.96995235234499, "len_probs": 204, "answer": "\nThe cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a pedicure is $40.\nBoth the manicure and pedicure cost $35 + $40 = $75.\nA salon offers a 20% discount on the total cost of $75, which is 20/100 x $75 = $15.\nSo, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.\nKaren would like to add nail art to her fingers, which costs $3 per nail.
