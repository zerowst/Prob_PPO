What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the temperature: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen add that to the starting temperature to find the total temperature after baking: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen find how much the temperature cooled after the window was open: 2 degrees/10 minutes * (30 minutes in total) = 6 degrees\nNow subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\nMarcus's house is 49 degrees after the baking and window opening.\n#### 49\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.95737887173891, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the temperature: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen add that to the starting temperature to find the total temperature after baking: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen find how much the temperature cooled after the window was open: 2 degrees/10 minutes * (30 minutes in total) = 6 degrees\nNow subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\nMarcus's house is 49 degrees after the baking and window opening.\n#### 49\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find how much the temperature increased from baking: 5 degrees per hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen add that to the starting temperature to find the total temperature after baking: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen find how much the temperature decreased from the window: 2 degrees per 10 minutes * (30 minutes / 60 minutes) = 2\nAdd that to the 55 degrees to find how much the temperature dropped: 55 degrees - 2 degrees = 53 degrees.\nSo the temperature after opening the window is 40 degrees + the temperature after the window was open: 40 degrees + 53 degrees = 93 degrees.\n#### 93\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
