After fifteen days, there will be three groups of three-day periods:\nThree-day periods: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\nThree groups of three-day periods, one period per group:\n0 + 3 + 6 = 9\n3 + 6 + 9 = 18\n1 + 4 + 7 = 12 (no additional arms will grow from these periods)\nIn total, there are 9 + 18 + 12 = 39 extra arms will grow.\nAfter five days, a person will grow a leg. After fifteen days, there will be five groups of five-day periods:\nFive-day periods: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20\nFive groups of five-day periods, one period per group:\n0 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 55\n5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50\nNo additional legs will grow from these periods, because there is no additional 5-day period.\nIn total, there are 39 + 0 = 39 extra legs will grow.\nThe answer is 39 extra arms + 0 extra legs = 39 extra limbs.\n#### 39\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter 15 days, the serum will cause an extra arm, which means one person will have an extra arm.
