three times as many cookies as Amir eats, which means he eats 3 * (1 cookie Amir eats) = 3 * 5 cookies\nThis is 3 * Amir's cookies, so it's 3 * (5 cookies Amir eats)\nThe total for both is 3 * Amir's cookies + Amir's cookies\nThat is 3 * Amir's cookies (which is 5 cookies) + Amir's cookies\nIt equals 5 + Amir's cookies\nAll together they eat: Amir's + (Amir's * 3 times)\nThat is 5 + (Amir's *

{"text": "\nCody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, which means he eats 3 * 5 cookies = 15 cookies.\nTogether they eat the number of cookies 15 + 5 = 20.\nSo, both of them together eats 20 cookies, which is the same as 20 cookies in one group (Cody and Amir's combined eating time).\nTherefore, the answer is the number of the group, 20, or 2 (a number that can be divided by 10 and 5 to
