Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are left until Andy's birthday. December 31st is December 31, 2019\nJuly 19th is July 19, 2019\nSo, Andy has 365-19=346 days until his birthday\nTo lose 30 lbs, he needs to burn 3500*346=1117,200 calories\nTo lose 1 pound he needs to burn 3500 calories\nSo, to lose 30 lbs he needs to burn: 30*3500=105,000 calories\nTherefore, in order to reach his goal, Andy needs to burn: 1117,200-105,000=62,200 calories per day\nSo, he needs to burn 62,200/346=185 calories per day to reach his goal (because 62,200/346 is 185).\n#### 185\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.447958670556545, "len_probs": 259, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are left until Andy's birthday.
