because a tip is usually given after the price of the food, and so should be added to the cost of the food before the tip.\nThat is, a tip is always added after the cost of the food is added, so it is always added after the money is paid.\nThat is why 18 is the final answer, and not 15 or something else.\nIt is always better to write your work in a clear and concise manner.\nIf you have a problem,
