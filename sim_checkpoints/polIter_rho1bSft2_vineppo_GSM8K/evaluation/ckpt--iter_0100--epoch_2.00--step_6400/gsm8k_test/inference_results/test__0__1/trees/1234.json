wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?\n\nSolution:\nIf Regina wrote 9 novels last year is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can calculate the number of novels she wrote this year by dividing 9 novels / 0.75 (since each quarter represents 1/4 of the total novels written in a year).\nSo,
