There are 7 more open parking spots on the second level than on the first level, and there are 6 more open parking spots on the third level than on the second level. There are 14 open parking spots on the fourth level. How many open parking spots are there in all?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 4 + 7 = 11 open parking spots on the second level.\nThere are 11 + 6 = 17 open parking spots on the third level.\nThere are 14 open parking spots on the fourth level.\nTherefore, there are 4 + 11 + 17 + 14 = 50 open parking spots in the parking area.\nThe total number of parking spots in the area is the number of spots on the first level + the number of spots on the second level + the number of spots on the third level + the number of spots on the fourth level.\nSo, there are 4 (level 1) + 11 (level 2, second level) + 17 (level 3, third level) + 14 (level 4, fourth level) = 50\nAll together there are 4 + 11 + 17 + 14 spots = 50\n#### 50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.452003926038742, "len_probs": 233, "answer": "\nThere are 4 + 7 = 11 open parking spots on the second level.\nThere are 11 + 6 = 17 open parking spots on the third level.\nThere are 14 open parking spots on the fourth level.\nTherefore, there are 4 + 11 + 17 + 14 = 50 open parking spots in the parking area.\nThe total number of parking spots in the area is the number of spots on the first level + the number of spots on the second level + the number of spots on the third level + the number of spots on the fourth level.\nSo, there are 4 (level 1) + 11 (level 2, second level) + 17 (level 3, third level) + 14 (level 4, fourth level) = 50\nAll together there are 4 + 11 + 17 + 14 spots = 50\n#### 50\n"}]}
