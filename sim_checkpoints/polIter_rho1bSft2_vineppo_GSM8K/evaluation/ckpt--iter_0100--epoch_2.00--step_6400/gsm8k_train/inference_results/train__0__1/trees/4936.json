A friend knows that Kim has a bunch of shiny new earrings that she loves. She agrees to give Kim 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings. On the first day, Kim brings her 3 pairs of earrings. On the second she brings her twice as many. On the third day, she brings 1 less than she brought on the second day. If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, she brings 3 pairs of earrings so she gets 3*9 = 27 gumballs\nOn the second day, she brings twice as many as the first day, so she brings 3*2= 6 pairs of earrings.\nThis means she brings 6*9 = 54 gumballs\nOn the third day, she brings 1 less than the second day, so she brings 6-1=5 pairs of earrings.\nThis means she brings 5*9 = 45 gumballs.\nSo in total, she has 27+54+45 = 126 gumballs\nEach day she eats 3 gumballs, so these gumballs will last her 126/3=42 days.\n#### 42\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.012725315988064, "len_probs": 193, "answer": "\nOn the first day, she brings 3 pairs of earrings so she gets 3*9 = 27 gumballs\nOn the second day, she brings twice as many as the first day, so she brings 3*2= 6 pairs of earrings.\nThis means she brings 6*9 = 54 gumballs\nOn the third day, she brings 1 less than the second day, so she brings 6-1=5 pairs of earrings.\nThis means she brings 5*9 = 45 gumballs.\nSo in total, she has 27+54+45 = 126 gumballs\nEach day she eats 3 gumballs, so these gumballs will last her 126/3=42 days.\n#### 42\n"}, {"text": "\nOn the first day, she brings 3 pairs of earrings so she get 3*9 = 27 gumballs\nOn the second day, she brings twice as many as the first day, so she brings 2*3 pairs of earrings = 6 pairs\nShe gets 6*9 = 54 gumballs\nOn the third day, she brings 1 less than the second day, so she brings 6-1 = 5 pairs\nShe gets 5*9 = 45 gumballs\nIn total, she has 27+54+45 = 126 gumballs\nEach day she eats 3 gumballs, so these gumballs will last her 126/3=42 days.\n#### 42\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKimberly loves gumballs and will trade almost anything she owns for them.
