Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?\n\nSolution:\nBess throws the Frisbee 20 meters * 4 times = 80 meters.\nBess throws the Frisbee back 80 meters * 1 (because she throws it back to her original position) = 80 meters.\nSo in total Bess\u2019s Frisbees travel 80 + 80 = 160 meters.\nHolly throws the Frisbee 8 meters * 5 times = 40 meters.\nSo Holly\u2019s Frisbees travel 40 meters each in total 40 + 40 = 80 meters.\nThe total distance the two Frisbees travel is 160 meters + 80 meters = 240 meters.\n#### 240\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.338972479104996, "len_probs": 174, "answer": "\nBess throws the Frisbee 20 meters * 4 times = 80 meters.\nBess throws the Frisbee back 80 meters * 1 (because she throws it back to her original position) = 80 meters.\nSo in total Bess\u2019s Frisbees travel 80 + 80 = 160 meters.\nHolly throws the Frisbee 8 meters * 5 times = 40 meters.\nSo Holly\u2019s Frisbees travel 40 meters each in total 40 + 40 = 80 meters.\nThe total distance the two Frisbees travel is 160 meters + 80 meters = 240 meters.\n#### 240\n"}]}
