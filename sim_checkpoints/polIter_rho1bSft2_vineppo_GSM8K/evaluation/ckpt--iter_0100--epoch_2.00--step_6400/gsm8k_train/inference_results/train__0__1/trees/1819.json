A shirt costs $7.50, a pair of pants cost $15, and socks cost $4.50 each if each team member buys the uniform items on their own. If they buy the items as a group, they are given a discount. A discounted shirt cost $6.75, a discounted pair of pants cost $13.50, and discounted socks cost $3.75. How much would their team of 12 save with the group discount?\n\nSolution:\nThe total cost of a shirt and pants without discount is $7.50 + $15 = $22.50.\nThe total cost of socks without discount is $4.50 each.\nSo, without discount, their total cost is $22.50 for shirt and pants + $4.50x (the number of socks).\nThe total cost for one member is $22.50 + $4.50x.\nIf they are a team of 12, they buy 12 - 1 (the team member who doesn't buy), so they buy 12 - 1 = 11\nSo, their total cost without discount for the group is: $22.50 + $4.50x + (4.50x - $3.75)\n$22.50 + $4.50x + (4.50x - $3.75) = $22.50 + $4.50x + 4.50x - $3.75\n$22.50 + $4.50x + 4.50x - $3.75 = $22.50 + $9x - $3.75\n$18.75 + $9x = $22.50\n$9x = $22.50 + $9\n$9x = $31.50\n$x = $31.50 / 9\n$x = $3.50\nThe cost for the team with the discount is $22.50 + $4.50x\n$22.50 + $4.50($3.50) = $22.50 + $15.\nSo, their team saves $22.50 + $15 = $37.50 with the group discount.\n#### 37.50\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -51.78083264827728, "len_probs": 450, "answer": "\nThe total cost of a shirt and pants without discount is $7.50 + $15 = $22.50.\nThe total cost of socks without discount is $4.50 each.\nSo, without discount, their total cost is $22.50 for shirt and pants + $4.50x (the number of socks).\nThe total cost for one member is $22.50 + $4.50x.\nIf they are a team of 12, they buy 12 - 1 (the team member who doesn't buy), so they buy 12 - 1 = 11\nSo, their total cost without discount for the group is: $22.50 + $4.50x + (4.50x - $3.75)\n$22.50 + $4.50x + (4.50x - $3.75) = $22.50 + $4.50x + 4.50x - $3.75\n$22.50 + $4.50x + 4.50x - $3.75 = $22.50 + $9x - $3.75\n$18.75 + $9x = $22.50\n$9x = $22.50 + $9\n$9x = $31.50\n$x = $31.50 / 9\n$x = $3.50\nThe cost for the team with the discount is $22.50 + $4.50x\n$22.50 + $4.50($3.50) = $22.50 + $15.\nSo, their team saves $22.50 + $15 = $37.50 with the group discount.\n#### 37.50\n"}]}
