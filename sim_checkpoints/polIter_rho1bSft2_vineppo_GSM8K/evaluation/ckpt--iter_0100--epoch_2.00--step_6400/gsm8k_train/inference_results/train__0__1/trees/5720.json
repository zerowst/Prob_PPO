How many earrings do all of the friends have?\n\nSolution:\nSince Bella has 10 earrings, Monica has 2 * (the number of Bella's earrings) = 2 * (the number of Rachel's earrings)\nThis means that the total number of Monica's earrings is 25% * (the total number of Rachel's earrings),\nSo if we let R be the total number of Rachel's earrings, we can say: 2 * R = Monica's earrings\nAnd we can say 2R = the number of Rachel's earrings, because Monica has twice as many as Rachel\nSo, all together have 10 + 2R + 2R = 10 + 3R\n#### 10 + 3R\n#### 3\n#### (R)\n#### (R)\n#### (R)\n#### (R)\n#### (R)\n####
