He orders goods from his supplier and writes them a cheque for $600. His debtor pays him $800 from the purchases they had made on credit. Mr. Ben then decides to do equipment maintenance and spends $1200 on the whole operation. How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with?\n\nSolution:\nAfter writing the cheque, Ben\u2019s balance was $2000 - $600 = $1400.\nAfter the debtor paid, Ben\u2019s balance was $1400 + $800 = $2200.\nAfter maintenance, Ben\u2019s balance was $2200 - $1200 = $1000.\nSo Ben is left with $1000 in money.\nThat means he has a balance of $1000.\nTherefore, the total amount of money in Ben\u2019s account is $1000 after the transactions.\nThat is the total amount he is going to be left with after all.\nSo the answer is, $1000.\nThis is because the transactions are being done in a bank account.\nSo the answer is, $1000.\n#### 1000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -46.4260571077466, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nAfter writing the cheque, Ben\u2019s balance was $2000 - $600 = $1400.\nAfter the debtor paid, Ben\u2019s balance was $1400 + $800 = $2200.\nAfter maintenance, Ben\u2019s balance was $2200 - $1200 = $1000.\nSo Ben is left with $1000 in money.\nThat means he has a balance of $1000.\nTherefore, the total amount of money in Ben\u2019s account is $1000 after the transactions.\nThat is the total amount he is going to be left with after all.\nSo the answer is, $1000.\nThis is because the transactions are being done in a bank account.\nSo the answer is, $1000.\n#### 1000\n"}, {"text": "\nAfter paying his supplier, Ben has $2000 - $600 = $1400.\nAfter his debtor pays him, he has $1400 + $800 = $2200.\nAfter his equipment maintenance, he is left with $2200 - $1200 = $1000.\nTherefore, Ben is $1000 remaining after all.\nThe amount he has is called his \"remaining money\" or \"profit\".\nIt is often written as \"R\" in the form of a fraction, like this: 1 1/2\nIt is also called \"net profit\".\nMr. Ben has 1000 dollars left.
