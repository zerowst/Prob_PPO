Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?\n\nSolution:\nTwo-thirds of the students at lunch today are sitting in the cafeteria, so there are (2/3) * 90 = 60 students in the cafeteria.\nThe remainder, or 1/3 of the students, are sitting outside, so there are (1/3) * 90 = 30 students outside\nSome students from outside ran inside and joined the students in the cafeteria, so 3 of the students outside are now inside.\nThis means that 1/3 of the students at lunch are now inside, so 90 - (60 + 30 - 9) =\nThere are now 60 + 3 + 9 = 72 students in the cafeteria.\n#### 72\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.11286022886634, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nTwo-thirds of the students at lunch today are sitting in the cafeteria, so there are (2/3) * 90 = 60 students in the cafeteria.\nThe remainder, or 1/3 of the students, are sitting outside, so there are (1/3) * 90 = 30 students outside\nSome students from outside ran inside and joined the students in the cafeteria, so 3 of the students outside are now inside.\nThis means that 1/3 of the students at lunch are now inside, so 90 - (60 + 30 - 9) =\nThere are now 60 + 3 + 9 = 72 students in the cafeteria.\n#### 72\n"}, {"text": "\nTwo-thirds of the 90 students in period 5 lunch are sitting in the cafeteria, which is a total of (90 * 2/3) = 60 students.\nThe remainder, which is 100% - 2/3 = 2/3, of the students are sitting outside the cafeteria.\nSo there are (90 * 2/3) * (1/3) = 60 outside\nSome of these students ran inside to the cafeteria, and 3 of them went outside to see what all the fuss was about.
