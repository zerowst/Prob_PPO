She likes to put a couple of sprigs of parsley on each plate for decoration. However, she is very low on parsley and doesn't have enough to even put 1 sprig on every plate, so she needs to break several of the parsley sprigs in two to make 2 smaller ones to stretch them out. If she decorates 8 plates with one whole parsley sprig and 12 plates with 1/2 a sprig each, how many sprigs of parsley does she have left if she started with 25?\n\nSolution:\nShe used 2 sprigs per 2 small sprigs of parsley to decorate the plates, so she used 25-8 = 17 plates\nShe decorated 17/1 = 17 of the plates with 2 small sprigs each\nShe decorated another 12/2 = 6 on the other half\nShe used 2*8 + 2*6 = 18\nShe started with 25 - 18 = 7\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -29.042578548192978, "len_probs": 115, "answer": "\nShe used 2 sprigs per 2 small sprigs of parsley to decorate the plates, so she used 25-8 = 17 plates\nShe decorated 17/1 = 17 of the plates with 2 small sprigs each\nShe decorated another 12/2 = 6 on the other half\nShe used 2*8 + 2*6 = 18\nShe started with 25 - 18 = 7\n#### 7\n"}]}
