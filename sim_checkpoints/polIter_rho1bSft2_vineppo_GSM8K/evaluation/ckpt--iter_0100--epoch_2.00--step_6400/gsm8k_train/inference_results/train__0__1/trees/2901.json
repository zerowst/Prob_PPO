$10.\nThe total cost for Billy and Jenny's meal is $40 + $10 = $50.\nBilly wants to pay 80% of a 20% tip, which is $50 x (20% of what amount?)\nThere will be a total of (what amount)\nThis means Billy wants to pay 80% of the total amount that Billy would have to pay if he didn't want to pay anything extra\nSo he wants to pay (what he's paying now)/(1-80%)\nSo the amount Billy wants to pay is $50 x (what percent of what he's paying now?), which is 50 x (what amount in dollars) / (100% - 80%)\nThe 50 is because 80% of $50 is $40, and that's what he's paying now\nThe (what amount in dollars) / (100% - 80%) part is what we need to solve for, in order to find out how much Billy should pay in tips\nSo the amount Billy wants to pay in tips is $50 x (what percent of $40?), which is 50 x (what amount in dollars) / (100% - 80%)\nSolving that, we get: $50 x (what percent of $40?)= $50 x (what amount in dollars) / (100% - 80%)\nSo the total amount Billy wants to pay in tips is $50 x (what percent of $40?)/(100% - 80%)\nSo if Billy wants to pay 80% of a 20% tip, the amount he wants to pay in tips is $50 x (what percent of $40?)/(100% - 80%)\nThe 80% of 20% tip is a total of 4\nSo the answer is 40\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -93.23259459063411, "len_probs": 495, "answer": "\nThe cost for the steaks for Billy and Jenny is $20 x 2 = $40.\nThe
