How many total insects were eaten?\n\nSolution:\nEach gecko eats 6 insects, so 5 geckos eat 5*6 = 30 insects.\nEach lizard eats twice as much as a gecko, so each lizard eats 6*2 = 12 insects.\n3 lizards eat 12*3 = 36 insects.\nAltogether they eat 30+36 = 66 insects.\nThe total insects eaten is 66 insects.\nThe number you have is 66. I am not sure if that is correct. Please correct if I am wrong.\nThe correct answer is 66 insects.\nThe other answer choices are not correct (60 and 40).\nIt is 66.\nThe insects were eaten by 5 geckos, each eating 6 insects, so 5 geckos * 6 insects = 30 insects.\nThree lizards, each eating twice as much as a gecko, were eating, each eating 12 insects, totaling (3 lizards)*12 insects=36 insects.\nAltogether the number of insects that were eaten by the geckos and the lizards is 30+36 = 66 insects.\nThe correct answer is 66 insects, not 40 or 60.\n#### 66\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -50.77457197010517, "len_probs": 321, "answer": "\nEach gecko eats 6 insects, so 5 geckos eat 5*6 = 30 insects.\nEach lizard eats twice as much as a gecko, so each lizard eats 6*2 = 12 insects.\n3 lizards eat 12*3 = 36 insects.\nAltogether they eat 30+36 = 66 insects.\nThe total insects eaten is 66 insects.\nThe number you have is 66.
