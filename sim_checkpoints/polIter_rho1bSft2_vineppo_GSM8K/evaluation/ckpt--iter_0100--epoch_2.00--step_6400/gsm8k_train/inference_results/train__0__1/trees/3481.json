If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and some kitchens.\nEach bedroom is a single room, and there is one room per bedroom, so each cylindrical structure has 12 + 0 = 12 rooms\nEach bathroom is a single room, and there is one room per bathroom, so each cylindrical structure has 7 + 0 = 7 rooms\nThus each cylindrical structure has 12 + 7 + 0 = 19 rooms in total.\nThe entire space station has 72 rooms, and so the three cylindrical structures have a total of 3 * 19 = 57 rooms.\nThere are 72 - 57 = 15 rooms that are not kitchens in the three cylindrical structures, which are the spaces between the rooms where you can't fit another room.\nEach space between two rooms is a kitchen, so there are 15 rooms that are not kitchens in the three cylindrical structures, which are the spaces between the rooms where you can't fit another room.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.613743610680103, "len_probs": 254, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and some kitchens.\nEach bedroom is a single room, and there is one room per bedroom, so each cylindrical structure has 12 + 0 = 12 rooms\nEach bathroom is a single room, and there is one room per bathroom, so each cylindrical structure has 7 + 0 = 7 rooms\nThus each cylindrical structure has 12 + 7 + 0 = 19 rooms in total.\nThe entire space station has 72 rooms, and so the three cylindrical structures have a total of 3 * 19 = 57 rooms.\nThere are 72 - 57 = 15 rooms that are not kitchens in the three cylindrical structures, which are the spaces between the rooms where you can't fit another room.\nEach space between two rooms is a kitchen, so there are 15 rooms that are not kitchens in the three cylindrical structures, which are the spaces between the rooms where you can't fit another room.\n#### 15\n"}, {"text": "\nEach cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.
