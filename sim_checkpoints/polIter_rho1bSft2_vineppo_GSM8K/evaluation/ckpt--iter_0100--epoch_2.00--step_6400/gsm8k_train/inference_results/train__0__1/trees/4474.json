When his coworker goes into anaphylactic shock and is taken to the hospital, Gerald is arrested. The judge sentences Gerald to 3 months for assault and 2 years for poisoning, then extends his sentence by 1/3 since this is Gerald's third offense. How many months does Gerald spend in jail?\n\nSolution:\nThe total sentence is 3 months for assault + 2 years for poisoning = 3 + 2*12 = 3 + 24\nSince it's a third-degree offense, he gets 1/3 extra time = (1/3)*(1/3)\nSo the total time he gets is 1/3 of what's already there = (1/3)*1/3\nSo he gets an additional 1 month of jail time for being a third-degree offense\nSo his total time is 3 + 24 +
