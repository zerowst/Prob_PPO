In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.  Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.  And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nSolution:\nPolly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar, who stood on his two back legs for 10 minutes, so Polly stands for 3*10 = 30 minutes on her two back legs.\nPetra stands for a fraction of time that is one-sixth of the time Polly stood, and since Polly stood for 30 minutes, Petra stands for 1/6*30 = 5 minutes on her back legs.\nWhen you add the three times Pulsar stood alone, the three times Polly stood alone, and the time Petra stood alone, we get the total time all three stand together: 10+30+5 = 45\nThe combined length of time the three entertainers stand on their back legs is the same as 45 minutes because they all did the same amount of time.\n#### 45\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.55439191311598, "len_probs": 196, "answer": "\nPolly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar, who stood on his two back legs for 10 minutes, so Polly stands for 3*10 = 30 minutes on her two back legs.\nPetra stands for a fraction of time that is one-sixth of the time Polly stood, and since Polly stood for 30 minutes, Petra stands for 1/6*30 = 5 minutes on her back legs.\nWhen you add the three times Pulsar stood alone, the three times Polly stood alone, and the time Petra stood alone, we get the total time all three stand together: 10+30+5 = 45\nThe combined length of time the three entertainers stand on their back legs is the same as 45 minutes because they all did the same amount of time.\n#### 45\n"}]}
