He wants to buy 5 kilograms of apples, 3 packs of sugar, and 500 grams of walnuts. One kilogram of apples costs $2, and one kilogram of walnuts costs $6. One pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than one kilogram of apples. How much Fabian needs to pay for the items he wants to buy?\n\nSolution:\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost $1 less than one kilogram of apples, so each pack costs $2 - $1 = $1 per kilogram.\nSo three packs of sugar cost $1 x 3 = $3.\n500 grams of walnuts cost $6 per kilogram, so they cost a total of $6 x (500/1000) = $3.\nAdd the cost of the three packs of sugar and the five kilograms of apples, and the total cost is: $3 + $10 + 500 grams of walnuts =\n$5 + 10 + 3 =\n$13 + 500 grams of walnuts\n= $503.\n#### 503\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.035479865968227, "len_probs": 197, "answer": "\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost $1 less than one kilogram of apples, so each pack costs $2 - $1 = $1 per kilogram.\nSo three packs of sugar cost $1 x 3 = $3.\n500 grams of walnuts cost $6 per kilogram, so they cost a total of $6 x (500/1000) = $3.\nAdd the cost of the three packs of sugar and the five kilograms of apples, and the total cost is: $3 + $10 + 500 grams of walnuts =\n$5 + 10 + 3 =\n$13 + 500 grams of walnuts\n= $503.\n#### 503\n"}, {"text": "\nFive kilograms of apples cost $2 x 5 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost $1 less per kilogram than one-kilogram of apples, so each pack costs $2 - $1 = $1 per kilogram.\nThis means three packs cost $1 x 3 = $3.\nAnd the total cost for all items is $10 + $3 + 500 grams of walnuts\nThe total cost is $10 + $3 + 500 grams of walnuts\nThe total cost is $10 + $3 + 500/0.4\nThe total cost is $10 + $3 + 1250\nThe total cost is $11 + 1250\nThe total cost is $13,100,\nFabian needs to pay $13,100.\n#### 13,100\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nFabian is shopping at a nearby supermarket.
