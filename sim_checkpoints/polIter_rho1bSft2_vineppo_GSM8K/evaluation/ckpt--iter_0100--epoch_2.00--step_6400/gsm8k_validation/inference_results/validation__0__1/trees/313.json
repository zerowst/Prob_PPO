His brother Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates than Nick hides. Last night, their mom found and took 5 chocolates from Alix. How many more chocolates does Alix have than Nick?\n\nSolution:\nAlix hides 10 x 3 = 30 chocolates.\nAfter his mom took some, Alix was left with 30 - 5 = 25 chocolates.\nSo, Alix has 25 - 10 (the chocolates Nick originally hid) = 15 more chocolates than Nick.\nToo many chocolates for you? How about a number that's just right?\nLet x be the number of chocolates\nAlix: 30 + 5\nNick: x\nTotal: 30 + 5 + x\nAlix has is 25 - (the number you just calculated for x)\nSo: 25 - (the number you just calculated for x) = 15\nSo, I'm looking for the number that:\nx + 30 + 5 = 25 - 15\nx + 35 = 10\nx = 10 - 35\nx = -25\nYou can't have a negative number of chocolates, so there's something wrong with your math.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -57.21026745438576, "len_probs": 268, "answer": "\nAlix hides 10 x 3 = 30 chocolates.\nAfter his mom took some, Alix was left with 30 - 5 = 25 chocolates.\nSo, Alix has 25 - 10 (the chocolates Nick originally hid) = 15 more chocolates than Nick.\nToo many chocolates for you?
