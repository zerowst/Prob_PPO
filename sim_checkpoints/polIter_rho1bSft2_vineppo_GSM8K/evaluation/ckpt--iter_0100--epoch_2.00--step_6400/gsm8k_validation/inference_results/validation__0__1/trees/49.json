How many times did he sled down the hills?\n\nSolution:\nWilson went down the 2 tall hills 4 times each, so he sled down there 2 * 4 = 8 times.\nWilson went down the 3 small hills half as often as the tall hills, so he went down each of those hills 4 * (1/2) = 2 times.\nThat means he went down the 3 small hills a total of 3 * 2 = 6 times.\nAdd the number of times he went down the tall and small hills together: 8 + 6 = 14.\nWilson sled down a total of 14 times the way you do.\nIf you're looking for the total number of sleds, you're missing something. You need to know the number of sleds in the tall and small hills combined, so you'll have to do that before you can figure out how many times he went sledding.\nIf you don't know the number of sleds in the tall and small hills, you can't figure this out.\nSo the answer is: It\u2019s not possible to tell how many times he went sledding without knowing the number of sleds in the tall and small hills combined.\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -54.94988415390253, "len_probs": 271, "answer": "\nWilson went down the 2 tall hills 4 times each, so he sled down there 2 * 4 = 8 times.\nWilson went down the 3 small hills half as often as the tall hills, so he went down each of those hills 4 * (1/2) = 2 times.\nThat means he went down the 3 small hills a total of 3 * 2 = 6 times.\nAdd the number of times he went down the tall and small hills together: 8 + 6 = 14.\nWilson sled down a total of 14 times the way you do.\nIf you're looking for the total number of sleds, you're missing something.
