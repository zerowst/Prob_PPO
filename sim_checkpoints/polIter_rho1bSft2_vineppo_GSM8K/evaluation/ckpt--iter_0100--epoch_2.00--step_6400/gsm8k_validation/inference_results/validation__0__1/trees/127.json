Right now, he drinks 48 sodas a week. If he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, how many weeks will it take him to only drink 6 sodas per week?\n\nSolution:\nJerry currently drinks 48 sodas per week. If he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, he will cut the number in half for the first time on the 4th week (4th week being the first time he cuts it in half).\nSo, after the 4th week, he will only be drinking 48/2=24 sodas per week.\nAfter the 5th week, he will be drinking his last 6-soda week (since he's cutting his intake in half).\nSo, after the 5th week, which is 4+1+1 (for the 4th, 5th, and 6th weeks)\nSo, Jerry will have had his last soda at the 5th week\nHence, it will take him 5-1=4 weeks to get his last 6 sodas per week.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -44.615493047982454, "len_probs": 210, "answer": "\nJerry currently drinks 48 sodas per week.
