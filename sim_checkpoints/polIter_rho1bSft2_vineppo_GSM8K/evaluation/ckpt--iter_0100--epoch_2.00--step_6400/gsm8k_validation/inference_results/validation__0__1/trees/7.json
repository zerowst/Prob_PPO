Pebbles make a splash that is a 1/4 meter wide. Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?\n\nSolution:\nThe total width of the splashes from the pebbles is 6 pebbles x 1/4 meter/pebble = 1.5 meters.\nThe total width of the splashes from the rocks is 3 rocks x 1/2 meter/rock = 1.5 meters.\nThe total width of the splashes from the boulders is 2 boulders x 2 meters/boulder = 4 meters.\nThe total width of all the splashes is 1.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 7 meters.\nTherefore TreQuan\u2019s total splash width is 7 meters. You can use this as a reference for your own splashes.\nYou can also use this as a reference to determine how much wider your splashes can be by comparing this to your own splashes.\n#### 7\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.32064062356949, "len_probs": 196, "answer": "\nThe total width of the splashes from the pebbles is 6 pebbles x 1/4 meter/pebble = 1.5 meters.\nThe total width of the splashes from the rocks is 3 rocks x 1/2 meter/rock = 1.5 meters.\nThe total width of the splashes from the boulders is 2 boulders x 2 meters/boulder = 4 meters.\nThe total width of all the splashes is 1.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 7 meters.\nTherefore TreQuan\u2019s total splash width is 7 meters.
