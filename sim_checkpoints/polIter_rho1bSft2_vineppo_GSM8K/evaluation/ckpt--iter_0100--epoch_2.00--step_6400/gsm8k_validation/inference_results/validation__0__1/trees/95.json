If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\n\nSolution:\nSince Omar can raise his kite 240 feet in 12 minutes, his rate is 240 feet / 12 minutes = 20 feet per minute.\nSince Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar, Jasper can raise his kite at 3 * 20 = 60 feet per minute.\nIf Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, it will take him 600 feet / (60 feet per minute) = 10 minutes to raise his kite.\nThe answer is 10, because it is the time it takes for Jasper to raise his kite.\nTherefore the answer is 10.
