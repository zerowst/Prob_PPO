To start, he decides to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. Near the end of the third set, he gets tired and does 5 fewer push-ups. How many push-ups did he do in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first three sets, he did 3 sets x 15 push-ups = 45 push-ups.\nIn the fourth set, he did 5 fewer push-ups than usual, so he did 15 - 5 = 10 push-ups.\nSo, in total Bryan did 45 + 10 = 55 push-ups.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the question. 55 is the total number of push-ups he did.\nSo, he did the task in 55.\nTherefore he did not make a mistake. He did the work correctly.\nThat\u2019s why he got the answer correct.\nThe correct answer is 55.\nSo, Bryan did the task correctly.\n#### 55\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -38.313059382140636, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nIn the first three sets, he did 3 sets x 15 push-ups = 45 push-ups.\nIn the fourth set, he did 5 fewer push-ups than usual, so he did 15 - 5 = 10 push-ups.\nSo, in total Bryan did 45 + 10 = 55 push-ups.\nThat\u2019s the answer to the question. 55 is the total number of push-ups he did.\nSo, he did the task in 55.\nTherefore he did not make a mistake.
