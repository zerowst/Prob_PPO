A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models in all (the kindergarten library had 2 models, and the elementary library had 4 more).\nThey initially planned to pay $100 x 2 = $200 for the kindergarten library models.\nSo they got a 5% discount on the $200, or $200 x 5% = $10 discount, for the kindergarten library models.\nThus, the school paid $200 - $10 = $190 for the kindergarten library models.\nThey also paid $100 x 4 = $400 for the elementary library models, but got a 5% discount, for $400 - $20 = $380.\nTherefore, the total cost for the school to buy the dinosaur models was $190 + $380 = $570.\n#### 570\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.445177383720875, "len_probs": 255, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models in all (the kindergarten library had 2 models, and the elementary library had 4 more).\nThey initially planned to pay $100 x 2 = $200 for the kindergarten library models.\nSo they got a 5% discount on the $200, or $200 x 5% = $10 discount, for the kindergarten library models.\nThus, the school paid $200 - $10 = $190 for the kindergarten library models.\nThey also paid $100 x 4 = $400 for the elementary library models, but got a 5% discount, for $400 - $20 = $380.\nTherefore, the total cost for the school to buy the dinosaur models was $190 + $380 = $570.\n#### 570\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library, so 2 x 2 (for the kindergarten) = 4 models in total for the elementary library.\nThe total number of models for both libraries is 2 (for kindergarten) + 4 (for elementary) = 6 models.\nThe original price of each model is $100.\nSo, the total cost without the discount is 6 x $100 = $600.\nThere was a 5% discount on the price, so the discount amount is (5/100)*$600 = $30.\nSo, the price the school paid for the models is $600 - $30 = $570.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
