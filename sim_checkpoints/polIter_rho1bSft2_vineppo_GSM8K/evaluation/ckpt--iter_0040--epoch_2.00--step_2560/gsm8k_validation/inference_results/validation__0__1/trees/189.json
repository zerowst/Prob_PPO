There are 15 people on the team. On the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets. On the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day by asking door-to-door. On the last day, they set up boxes at schools and got a total of 22 blankets. How many blankets did they collect for the three days for donation?\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets, so a total of 15 people * 2 blankets/person = 30 blankets were collected on the first day.\nOn the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day, so they collected 30 blankets * 3 = 90 blankets.\nOn the last day, they collected 22 blankets.\nThe total is the sum of all the blankets they collected on the three days, so 22 + 90 + 30 = 142 blankets.\n#### 142\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.253165680915117, "len_probs": 139, "answer": "\nOn the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets, so a total of 15 people * 2 blankets/person = 30 blankets were collected on the first day.\nOn the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day, so they collected 30 blankets * 3 = 90 blankets.\nOn the last day, they collected 22 blankets.\nThe total is the sum of all the blankets they collected on the three days, so 22 + 90 + 30 = 142 blankets.\n#### 142\n"}]}
