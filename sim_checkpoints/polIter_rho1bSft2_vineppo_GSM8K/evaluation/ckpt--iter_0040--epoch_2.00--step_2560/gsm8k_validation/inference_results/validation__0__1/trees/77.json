There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so together a machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach machine therefore holds 180 coins / 3 coins/machine = 60 machines.\nErin had no money before she emptied the machines, so the money in the machines is $90, which is equal to 90 / 3 coins/machine = 30 coins.\nThus 30 coins / 3 coins/machine = 10 machines.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.174351043999195, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so together a machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach machine therefore holds 180 coins / 3 coins/machine = 60 machines.\nErin had no money before she emptied the machines, so the money in the machines is $90, which is equal to 90 / 3 coins/machine = 30 coins.\nThus 30 coins / 3 coins/machine = 10 machines.\n#### 10\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, so Erin's machines held a total of 80 quarters per machine * 1 machine = $80 from quarters.\nThere were 100 dimes in a machine, so Erin's machines held a total of 100 dimes per machine * 1 machine = $100 from dimes.\nThe total from quarters and dimes is $80 + $100 = $180.\nThe total from all the machines is $90, so the money from the dimes must be $90 total - $180 from quarters = $90 from dimes.\nThis means that there were $90 from dimes / (100 dimes/machine) = 90/100 = 9/10 of machines that were filled with dimes.\nSo, the total number of machines is 100/100 + 9/10 = 100/10 + 9/10 = 10 + 9 = 19 machines.\n#### 19\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
