But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nSolution:\nThe ship sailed 20 hours * 30 km/hr = 600 kilometers due east.\nThe ship was then blown 1/3 of the way to its destination, so it was 1/3 * total distance to destination = 1/3 * 300 = 100 km further west.\nThus, the ship was blown 100 km west in total.\n#### 100\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.11316765844822, "len_probs": 101, "answer": "\nThe ship sailed 20 hours * 30 km/hr = 600 kilometers due east.\nThe ship was then blown 1/3 of the way to its destination, so it was 1/3 * total distance to destination = 1/3 * 300 = 100 km further west.\nThus, the ship was blown 100 km west in total.\n#### 100\n"}]}
