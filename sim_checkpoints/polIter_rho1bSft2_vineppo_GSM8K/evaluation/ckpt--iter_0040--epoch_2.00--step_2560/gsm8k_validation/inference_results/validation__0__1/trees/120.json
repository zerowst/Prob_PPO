She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 40 guests arriving at the party, and each car can fit 4 wheels, so the cars should be able to hold 40*4=160 wheels.\nHowever, Dylan's mother's car and her husband's jeep are not in the parking lot, so we must subtract those two cars from the total, leaving us with 160-2*4=152 wheels.\nIncluding Dylan's mother's car and her husband's jeep, there are 4 cars in the parking lot with wheels, so we multiply the number of wheels by 4 to find the total number of wheels, which is 4*152=608 wheels.\n#### 608\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.060238420963287, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nThere are 40 guests arriving at the party, and each car can fit 4 wheels, so the cars should be able to hold 40*4=160 wheels.\nHowever, Dylan's mother's car and her husband's jeep are not in the parking lot, so we must subtract those two cars from the total, leaving us with 160-2*4=152 wheels.\nIncluding Dylan's mother's car and her husband's jeep, there are 4 cars in the parking lot with wheels, so we multiply the number of wheels by 4 to find the total number of wheels, which is 4*152=608 wheels.\n#### 608\n"}, {"text": "\nSince each guest arrives in one car, and there are 40 guests, there are 40 cars in the parking lot.\nSince each car has 4 wheels, and there are 40 cars, the total number of wheels from cars is 40*4=160 wheels.\nThe 2 parents of Dylan's mother also have cars, and each of their cars has 4 wheels, for a total of 2*4=8 wheels from Dylan's parents' cars.\nAltogether, Dylan's mother's guests have a total of 160+8=168 car wheels in the parking lot.\n#### 168\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nDylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend.
