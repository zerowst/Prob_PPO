In 18 months, she will be 10 years old.  How many months old is Antonio?\n\nSolution:\nFirst we need to figure out how many years Isabella will be old in 18 months. We do this by dividing 10 years by 10 years per 18 months. This gives us 10/18*18 = 10 years.\nSince Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we divide 10 years by 2 to find how old Antonio is. This gives us 10/2 = 5 years.\nSince the years are converted to months, we multiply 5 years by 12 months per year to find that Antonio is 60 months old.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.105433233082294, "len_probs": 139, "answer": "\nFirst we need to figure out how many years Isabella will be old in 18 months.
