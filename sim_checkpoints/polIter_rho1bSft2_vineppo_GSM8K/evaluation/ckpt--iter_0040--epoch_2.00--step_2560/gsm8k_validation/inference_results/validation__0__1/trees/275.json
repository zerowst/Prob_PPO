A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe school paid 5% less for each model, so each model cost 100 - 5 = 95% of the original price.\nTherefore, the school paid 95/100 * $100 = $95 for each kindergarten model.\nSo the school paid 2 * $95 = $190 for the kindergarten models.\nThe school also paid 95/100 * $100 = $95 for each elementary model.\nSo the school paid 4 * $95 = $380 for the elementary models.\nThus, the school paid a total of $190 + $380 = $570 for all the dinosaur models.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $570.\n#### 570\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.637247145175934, "len_probs": 245, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so it bought 2 * 2 = 4 models for the elementary library.\nThe school bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nThe school paid 5% less for each model, so each model cost 100 - 5 = 95% of the original price.\nTherefore, the school paid 95/100 * $100 = $95 for each kindergarten model.\nSo the school paid 2 * $95 = $190 for the kindergarten models.\nThe school also paid 95/100 * $100 = $95 for each elementary model.\nSo the school paid 4 * $95 = $380 for the elementary models.\nThus, the school paid a total of $190 + $380 = $570 for all the dinosaur models.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $570.\n#### 570\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many models for the elementary library as for the kindergarten library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nThe reduction in price for each model is 100 x 5/100 = $5.\nThe price for each model after the reduction is 100 - 5 = $95.\nSo the school paid 6 x 95 = $570 in total for the models.\n#### 570\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
