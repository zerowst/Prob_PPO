Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?\n\nSolution:\nSince two-thirds of the students were in the cafeteria, there were 90*(2/3)=60 in the cafeteria.\nThe remainder, 1/3, sat outside, so there were 90-60=30 outside.\nOne-third of those outside ran inside, so 30*(1/3)=10 ran inside.\nThus, there were 60-10=50 in the cafeteria after 3 ran inside.\nBut 3 ran out again, so there were 50-3=47 in the cafeteria after 3 ran out.\nSo the answer is 47.\n#### 47\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.491689942777157, "len_probs": 160, "answer": "\nSince two-thirds of the students were in the cafeteria, there were 90*(2/3)=60 in the cafeteria.\nThe remainder, 1/3, sat outside, so there were 90-60=30 outside.\nOne-third of those outside ran inside, so 30*(1/3)=10 ran inside.\nThus, there were 60-10=50 in the cafeteria after 3 ran inside.\nBut 3 ran out again, so there were 50-3=47 in the cafeteria after 3 ran out.\nSo the answer is 47.\n#### 47\n"}, {"text": "\nThere were 90 students in the cafeteria today, because 90 x (2/3) = 60 students sat in the cafeteria.\nThere were 30 outside the cafeteria because 90 - 60 = 30 students were outside.\nThere were 10 students in the cafeteria after 3 ran out because 30 - 3 = 27 students who were outside ran back to the cafeteria.\nThere are 37 students in the cafeteria now because 60 + 27 = 87 students who were in the cafeteria.\n#### 87\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThere are 90 students who have lunch during period 5.
