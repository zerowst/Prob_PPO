row = 20 wheels per row.\nThere are 4 rows per carriage, so there are 4 rows per carriage * 192 wheels per carriage = 768 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 20 wheels per row = 80 wheels.\nThere are 4 rows per carriage, so there are 4 rows per carriage * 768 wheels per carriage = 3072 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 80 wheels = 320 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 3072 wheels = 12208 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 320 wheels = 1280 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 12208 wheels = 50832 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 1280 wheels = 5120 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 50832 wheels = 203392 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 5120 wheels = 204800 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 203392 wheels = 810576 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 204800 wheels = 825200 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together they have 4 trains * 810576 wheels = 3242192 wheels.\nThere are 4 trains, so together
