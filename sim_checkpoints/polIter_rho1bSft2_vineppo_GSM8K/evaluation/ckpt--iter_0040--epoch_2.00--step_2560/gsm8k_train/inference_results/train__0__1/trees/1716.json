How much was the class able to gather together?\n\nSolution:\nThere were 25 students in the class, so if everyone paid the full amount, they would have gathered 25*50 = $1250.\nThere were 4 students who paid half, so they paid 4*50/2 = $100.\nThere were 25-4 = 21 students who paid the full amount.\nThus, the total they gathered was 21*50=$1050.\nThe class was able to gather 1050+100 = $1150.\n#### 1150\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.441171303391457, "len_probs": 134, "answer": "\nThere were 25 students in the class, so if everyone paid the full amount, they would have gathered 25*50 = $1250.\nThere were 4 students who paid half, so they paid 4*50/2 = $100.\nThere were 25-4 = 21 students who paid the full amount.\nThus, the total they gathered was 21*50=$1050.\nThe class was able to gather 1050+100 = $1150.\n#### 1150\n"}, {"text": "\nThe number of students who paid full amount is 25-4 = 21 students.\nThe full amount paid by each of these students is $50, so the total amount paid by them is 21*50 = $1050.\nThe number of students who paid half is 4, so half amount paid by each of them is $50/2 = $25.\nThe total amount paid by these 4 students is 4*25 = $100.\nThe total amount gathered by the class is the sum of the full amount and the half amount paid by the other students, which is 1050+100 = 1150.\n#### 1150\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIn Mary's class, there are 25 students.
