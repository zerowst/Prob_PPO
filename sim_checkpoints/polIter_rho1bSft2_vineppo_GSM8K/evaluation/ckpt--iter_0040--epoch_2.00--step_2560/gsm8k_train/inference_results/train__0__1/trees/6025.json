If the cashier gives her the smallest number of coins possible as change, how many coins will Rosie get as change?\n\nSolution:\nRosie pays with a $1 bill, which is worth 100 cents. So Rosie gives the cashier 100 cents.\nThe cashier gives Rosie a $.44 piece of candy, which is worth 44 cents. So Rosie is charged 44 cents in tax.\nThe total amount Rosie is charged is 100 cents + 44 cents = 144 cents.\nSince 100 cents equal 1 dollar, then 144 cents equal 144/100 = 1.44 dollars.\nSince the cashier wants to give Rosie the smallest number of coins possible, then the cashier will give Rosie 1 dollar in change, which is worth 100 cents.\nThus Rosie will receive 100 cents in change, which is equal to 100/100 = 1 dollar.\nTherefore Rosie will receive 1 dollar in change.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.27392365038395, "len_probs": 241, "answer": "\nRosie pays with a $1 bill, which is worth 100 cents.
