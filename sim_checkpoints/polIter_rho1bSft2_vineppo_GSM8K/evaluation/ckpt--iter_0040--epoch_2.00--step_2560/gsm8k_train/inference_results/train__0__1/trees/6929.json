If she realizes a $120 profit on her sales, how many people have she sold the books to if each book costs $5 to make and every customer buys 2 at a time?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to find the profit per book. We do this by subtracting the cost from the profit: $120 / 5 books = $24 profit per book.\nThen we divide the total profit by the profit per book to find the total profit: $24 / book = $120 / books\nThis means that she sold her books for a total of $120 / books.\nSince she gets paid $20 for each book sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per book to find the number of books sold: $120 / books = 60 books.\nWe divide this by the number of books per customer to find the number of customers: 60 books / 2 books/customer = 30 customers.\n#### 30\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.118410624563694, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to find the profit per book.
