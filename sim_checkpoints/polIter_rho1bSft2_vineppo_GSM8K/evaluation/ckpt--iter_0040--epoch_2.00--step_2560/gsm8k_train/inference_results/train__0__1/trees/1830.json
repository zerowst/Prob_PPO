Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\n\nSolution:\nMary took twice as long as Susan, so she took 100*2 = 200 seconds.\nSusan took 10 seconds longer than Jen, so she took 30+10 = 40 seconds.\nJen finished in 30 seconds, so Tiffany had to run 30-7 = 23 seconds to finish the race.\nAdding up all the times, Mary took 200 seconds, Susan took 40 seconds, Jen took 30 seconds, and Tiffany took 23 seconds, so 200+40+30+23 = 273 seconds\n#### 273\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.24570394307375, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nMary took twice as long as Susan, so she took 100*2 = 200 seconds.\nSusan took 10 seconds longer than Jen, so she took 30+10 = 40 seconds.\nJen finished in 30 seconds, so Tiffany had to run 30-7 = 23 seconds to finish the race.\nAdding up all the times, Mary took 200 seconds, Susan took 40 seconds, Jen took 30 seconds, and Tiffany took 23 seconds, so 200+40+30+23 = 273 seconds\n#### 273\n"}, {"text": "\nMary ran twice as long as Susan, so Mary ran 2 * (Susan's time) = 2 * (Susan's time) + 10 seconds.\nSusan ran 10 seconds longer than Jen, so Susan's time was Jen's time + 10 seconds.\nJen ran 30 seconds, so Susan's time was Jen's time + 10 seconds = 30 + 10 = 40 seconds.\nTiffany ran 7 seconds less than Mary, so Tiffany ran Mary's time - 7 seconds = 2 * (Susan's time) - 7 seconds.\nMary ran twice as long as Susan, so Mary's time was 2 * (Susan's time) = 2 * (Susan's time) + 10 seconds.\nTogether, Mary, Susan, Jen, and Tiffany ran (2 * Susan's time + 10 seconds) + (Susan's time + 10 seconds) + (Susan's time + 40 seconds) + (2 * Susan's time + 7 seconds) = 100 seconds.\nCombining like terms, we get 100 seconds = 5 * Susan's time + 10 seconds + 40 seconds + 7 seconds.\nCombining like terms again, we get 100 seconds = 5 * Susan's time + 57 seconds.\nSubtracting 57 from both sides, we get 43 seconds = 5 * Susan's time.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get Susan's time = 43 / 5 = 8.6 seconds.\nTogether, Mary, Susan, Jen, and Tiffany ran (2 * Susan's time + 10 seconds) + (Susan's time + 10 seconds) + (Susan's time + 40 seconds) + (2 * Susan's time + 7 seconds) = 100 seconds.\nCombining like terms, we get 100 seconds = 5 * Susan's time + 10 seconds + 40 seconds + 7 seconds.\nCombining like terms again, we get 100 seconds = 5 * Susan's time + 57 seconds.\nSubtracting 57 from both sides, we get 43 seconds = 5 * Susan's time.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get Susan's time = 43 / 5 = 8.6 seconds.\n#### 43\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\n4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race.
