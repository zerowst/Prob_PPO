The company she used to work with was not doing well which is why she lost her job. So she spent 20% of her savings for her expenses in February, 40% of it in March, and $1500 in April. How much did she have in her savings account if she still has $2900 after spending those amounts?\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount she spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60% of her savings.\nSince she spent 60% of her savings, this means 60% * X = $2900\nDividing both sides by 60% gives X = $2900 / 0.6 = $4877.89\nTherefore, Reese had $4877.89 in her savings account before she got the $1500 in April.\nAdding the money she got in April to the money she had saved, she will have $4877.89 + 1500 = $6377.89\n#### 6377.89\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.136453114449978, "len_probs": 176, "answer": "\nThe total amount she spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60% of her savings.\nSince she spent 60% of her savings, this means 60% * X = $2900\nDividing both sides by 60% gives X = $2900 / 0.6 = $4877.89\nTherefore, Reese had $4877.89 in her savings account before she got the $1500 in April.\nAdding the money she got in April to the money she had saved, she will have $4877.89 + 1500 = $6377.89\n#### 6377.89\n"}, {"text": "\nIf she had $2900 after spending $1500 in April, this means she had $2900+1500= $4400 in March.\nThis is 40% of the total amount in her savings account, so the total amount in her savings account is 100%/40%*$4400=$11000.\nThis means she had $11000 in her savings account before she spent money in February and March.\nIf she spent 20% of her savings in February, this means she spent 20%*$11000=$2200 in February.\nThis means she had $11000-$2200=$8800 in her savings account after she spent money in February.\nFinally, if she had $8800 in her savings account after spending money in February, this means she had $8800+$4400=$13200 in her savings account after spending money in March and April.\nThis means she had $13200 in her savings account before she spent money in March and April.\n#### 13200\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nReese had a sum of money in her savings account.
