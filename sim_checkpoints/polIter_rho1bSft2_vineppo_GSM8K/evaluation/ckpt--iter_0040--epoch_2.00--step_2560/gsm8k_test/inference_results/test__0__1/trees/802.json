She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras and four stuffed frogs. If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?\n\nSolution:\nBubbles currently has 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 14 stuffed animals.\nShe needs this number to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, so she wants 14 stuffed animals to be 30% of her total stuffed animal collection. This means there should be 14 stuffed animals / (1 + 0.3) = 14 / 1.3 = 11.53846 stuffed animals total.\nSo she should buy 11.53846 - 14 = -2.46154 stuffed animals.\nSince she can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, she should buy 2 more stuffed animals.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.225277058780193, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nBubbles currently has 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 14 stuffed animals.\nShe needs this number to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, so she wants 14 stuffed animals to be 30% of her total stuffed animal collection.
