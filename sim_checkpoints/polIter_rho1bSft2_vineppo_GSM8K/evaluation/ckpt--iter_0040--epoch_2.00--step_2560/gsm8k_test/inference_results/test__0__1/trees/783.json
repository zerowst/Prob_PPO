How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?\n\nSolution:\nAt the store, Bob was given 17 fish, which were a mixture of white and orange. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. This means that 17 fish were 3+4 = 7 fish of one color, and 10 fish were of the other color.\nBob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, which means the number of white fish is 1/2*4 = 2\nHe was given 17 fish, and this number is made up of 3 orange and 10 white fish. This means he was given 17 = 3+10 = 13 fish\nHe had 7 fish he already had, which is 7 fish = 13 fish he got from the pet store.\nThis means he was given 13-7 = 6 fish, which are white fish.\nThere were 4 white fish, so he bought 6 fish he didn't already have, which means he bought 6 fish / 2 fish/white fish = 3 white fish.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -49.70283280313015, "len_probs": 234, "answer": "\nAt the store, Bob was given 17 fish, which were a mixture of white and orange. 3 were orange, and 4 were white.
