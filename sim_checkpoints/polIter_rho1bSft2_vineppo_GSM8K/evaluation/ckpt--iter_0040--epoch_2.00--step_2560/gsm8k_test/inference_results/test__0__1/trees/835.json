are traveling at a combined speed of 1/3 of the turtles' speed, the combined speed of the turtles is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3 times their speed.\nIf it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel, 1 kangaroo would take 3*18/3= 3 hours to travel.\nIf a turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take 3*2= 6 hours to travel the same distance.\nIf four turtles are traveling at half the speed of a
