The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the volume of the pool: 14 ft * 25 ft * 4 ft = 1,000 cubic feet\nThen multiply that by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed: 1,000 ft\u00b3 * 5.9 = 5,900 gallons\nThen multiply that number by the cost per gallon to find the total cost: 5,900 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $590\n#### 590\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -10.474864587187767, "len_probs": 120, "answer": "\nFirst find the volume of the pool: 14 ft * 25 ft * 4 ft = 1,000 cubic feet\nThen multiply that by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed: 1,000 ft\u00b3 * 5.9 = 5,900 gallons\nThen multiply that number by the cost per gallon to find the total cost: 5,900 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $590\n#### 590\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst, multiply the width by the length to find the volume of the pool: 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1,700 cubic feet.\nThen multiply that number by 5.9 to find the total volume in gallons: 1,700 cubic feet * 5.9 = 1,003 gallons.\nThen multiply that number by the cost per gallon to find the total cost: 1,003 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $100.30.\n#### 100.30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled.
