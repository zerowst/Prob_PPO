You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam\u2019s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?\n\nSolution:\nAdam is currently 40 inches tall and he grows 2 inches a year so he grows 2 inches/year * 1 year = 2 inches\nHe needs to be 4 feet tall before he is tall enough to ride the coaster so we need to convert his height to feet because the coaster is measured in feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot so 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet\nHe needs to grow 2 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.167 feet\nHe needs to grow this amount to be tall enough to ride the coaster so we need to divide the amount he needs to grow by the amount he grows each year 0.167 feet / 2 inches/year = 0.0835 years\nAdam will be 40 inches tall in 3.33 years so he will be tall enough to ride the coaster in 3.33 years + 0.0835 years = 3.4135 years\n#### 3.4135\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.645197685807943, "len_probs": 243, "answer": "\nAdam is currently 40 inches tall and he grows 2 inches a year so he grows 2 inches/year * 1 year = 2 inches\nHe needs to be 4 feet tall before he is tall enough to ride the coaster so we need to convert his height to feet because the coaster is measured in feet.
