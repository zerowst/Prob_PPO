If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?\n\nSolution:\nThe sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours it will move 10*5 = 50 degrees.\nThe pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees, so after the sun moves 50 degrees from the pyramid, the angle will be 32+50 = 82 degrees.\nIf we draw a line from the entrance of the pyramid to the sun, we have a right triangle. The angle between the ground and the sun is 82 degrees, and the angle between the ground and the entrance of the pyramid is 32 degrees. We can use the tangent function to find the height of the pyramid from the entrance of the pyramid:\ntan(32)=opposite/adjacent\ntan(32)=82/x\nx=82/tan(32)\nx=42.8\nSo the height of the pyramid from the entrance is 42.8 units.\n#### 42.8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.290009785443544, "len_probs": 228, "answer": "\nThe sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours it will move 10*5 = 50 degrees.\nThe pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees, so after the sun moves 50 degrees from the pyramid, the angle will be 32+50 = 82 degrees.\nIf we draw a line from the entrance of the pyramid to the sun, we have a right triangle.
