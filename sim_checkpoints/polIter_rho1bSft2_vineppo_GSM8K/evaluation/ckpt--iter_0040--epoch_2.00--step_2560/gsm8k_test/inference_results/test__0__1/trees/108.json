He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?\n\nSolution:\nLet X be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to bake 2X cookies this year.\nHenry baked 2X-X=X cookies last year.\nHenry baked X+15 cookies this year.\nHenry dropped 5 cookies, so he now has X+15-5 = X+10 cookies.\nHenry wants to have X+10 cookies, but he only has 110 cookies.\nTherefore, we have the equation X+10=110.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get X=100.\n#### 100\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.492471668869257, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nLet X be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to bake 2X cookies this year.\nHenry baked 2X-X=X cookies last year.\nHenry baked X+15 cookies this year.\nHenry dropped 5 cookies, so he now has X+15-5 = X+10 cookies.\nHenry wants to have X+10 cookies, but he only has 110 cookies.\nTherefore, we have the equation X+10=110.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get X=100.\n#### 100\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.\nHenry wants to bake twice as many as he did last year, so he wants 2x cookies this year.\nHenry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so 2x = x + 15.\nSolving for x, we get x = 15.\nHenry baked 15 cookies last year, so he wants to bake 2 * 15 = 30 cookies this year.\nHenry bakes 30 cookies this year and then drops 5 cookies, so he has 30 + 5 = 35 cookies.\nFinally, we subtract the cookies he dropped, so 35 - 5 = 30 cookies did Henry bake last year.\n#### 30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nHenry is making cookies for a local baking competition.
