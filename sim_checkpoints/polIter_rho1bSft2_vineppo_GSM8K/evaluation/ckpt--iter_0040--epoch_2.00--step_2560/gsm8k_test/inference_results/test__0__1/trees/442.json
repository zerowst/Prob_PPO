He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven has raised the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is 40+15=55 degrees.\nAfter 30 minutes, the temperature drops by 2*30/60=1 degree.\nThe temperature after the window is open is 55-1=54 degrees.\nThen the temperature drops by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so it drops by another 1 degree.\nThe final temperature is 54-1=53 degrees.\n#### 53\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.229616422206163, "len_probs": 141, "answer": "\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the oven has raised the temperature by 5*3=15 degrees.\nThe temperature after 3 hours is 40+15=55 degrees.\nAfter 30 minutes, the temperature drops by 2*30/60=1 degree.\nThe temperature after the window is open is 55-1=54 degrees.\nThen the temperature drops by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so it drops by another 1 degree.\nThe final temperature is 54-1=53 degrees.\n#### 53\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find how many degrees the oven raised the temperature: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.\nThen add that amount to the initial temperature of the house: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\nThen find how many degrees the house cools down after the window is open: 2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes = 6 degrees.\nThen subtract that amount from the temperature after the oven was on: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\nThen add back the 3 hours the oven was on because the temperature was rising: 49 degrees + 3 hours * (5 degrees/hour) = 49 degrees + 15 degrees = 64 degrees.\n#### 64\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWhen Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees.
