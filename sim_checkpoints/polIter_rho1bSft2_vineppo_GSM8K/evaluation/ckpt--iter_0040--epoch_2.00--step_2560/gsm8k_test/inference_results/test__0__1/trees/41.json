Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?\n\nSolution:\nWhen holding the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nThus, Polly could stand 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet outside of the dragon's reach.\nHowever, since she could hit the dragon at a distance of 1200 feet with the javelin, she could not stand outside of the dragon's reach at all.\nThus, the answer is 0.\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.40059357881546, "len_probs": 121, "answer": "\nWhen holding the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nThus, Polly could stand 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet outside of the dragon's reach.\nHowever, since she could hit the dragon at a distance of 1200 feet with the javelin, she could not stand outside of the dragon's reach at all.\nThus, the answer is 0.\n#### 0\n"}]}
