Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good days and eight bad days and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?\n\nSolution:\nOver the past thirty days, Christina had 12 good + 8 bad + 8 neutral = 30 days\nIf she had 30 days, and she had 12 days that were good, then 30-12 = 18 days were neutral or bad\nIf the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, then those days are 3rd, 4th, and 5th from the start of the month, so 3 days were good.\nThere were 12 days that were good out of the remaining days, so 18-3 = 15 days left had a good mood.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -26.04382809251547, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nOver the past thirty days, Christina had 12 good + 8 bad + 8 neutral = 30 days\nIf she had 30 days, and she had 12 days that were good, then 30-12 = 18 days were neutral or bad\nIf the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, then those days are 3rd, 4th, and 5th from the start of the month, so 3 days were good.\nThere were 12 days that were good out of the remaining days, so 18-3 = 15 days left had a good mood.\n#### 15\n"}]}
