So Greg needs to buy a total of 30 kids * 4 jello cups / kid = 120 jello cups.\nOne box of flavored jello makes 10 jello cups and he needs 120 jello cups, so he needs 120 jello cups / 10 jello cups per box = 12 boxes of flavored jello.\nEach box of flavored jello is $1.25 and he is buying 12 boxes so he will spend 1.25 * 12 = $15.00 on flavored jello.\n#### 15\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.796554505825043, "len_probs": 173, "answer": "\nThere will be 30 kids at the party and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
