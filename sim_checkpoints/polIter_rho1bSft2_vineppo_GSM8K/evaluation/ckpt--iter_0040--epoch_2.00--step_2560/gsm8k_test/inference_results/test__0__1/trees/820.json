Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the number of minutes Sandy walked for the first day is 8*60 = 480 minutes.\nOn the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is 1/2*480 = 240 minutes.\nThe total number of minutes Sandy walked on the two days is 480+240 = 720 minutes.\nIf you convert the minutes to hours, you get 720/60 = 12 hours.\nThe total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 12 hours.\nThe total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is 12*60 = 720 minutes.\n#### 720\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.470708385109901, "len_probs": 198, "answer": "\nOn the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
