They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?\n\nSolution:\nBlake ran 150 yards because 100 yards x 15 = 150 yards.\nBlake ran 10 yards per round because 150 yards / 15 rounds = 10 yards per round.\nBlake ran 100 yards in total because 10 yards per round x 10 rounds = 100 yards.\nKelly ran 100 yards because 40 yards x 34 = 1,360 yards.\nKelly ran 10 yards per round because 1,360 yards / 34 rounds = 39.28 yards per round.\nKelly ran 100 yards in total because 10 yards per round x 10 rounds = 100 yards.\nKelly ran 10 yards less than Blake because 100 yards - 100 yards = 10 yards.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.183600783348083, "len_probs": 220, "answer": "\nBlake ran 150 yards because 100 yards x 15 = 150 yards.\nBlake ran 10 yards per round because 150 yards / 15 rounds = 10 yards per round.\nBlake ran 100 yards in total because 10 yards per round x 10 rounds = 100 yards.\nKelly ran 100 yards because 40 yards x 34 = 1,360 yards.\nKelly ran 10 yards per round because 1,360 yards / 34 rounds = 39.28 yards per round.\nKelly ran 100 yards in total because 10 yards per round x 10 rounds = 100 yards.\nKelly ran 10 yards less than Blake because 100 yards - 100 yards = 10 yards.\n#### 10\n"}, {"text": "\nBlake ran 1500 yards because 100 yards x 15 = 1500\nBlake ran 1500 yards because 150 yards x 15 = 1500\nBlake ran 1500 yards because 150 yards x 15 = 1500\nBlake ran 450 yards more because 1500 - 1500 = 450\nKelly ran 1200 yards because 40 yards x 34 = 1200\nKelly ran 1200 yards because 1200 - 1500 = -300\nKelly ran 300 yards less because -300 - 450 = -750\nThe winner ran 750 yards more because 450 - 1500 = -1050\nThe winner ran 750 yards more because -1050 - 750 = -1800\nThe winner ran 1800 yards more because 750 - 450 = 300\n#### 300\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBlake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes.
