She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie makes 12 cups of lemonade per pitcher and she sells each cup for $1, so she makes 12*1 = $12 per pitcher.\nShe spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, so the cost per pitcher is 18/3 = $6 per pitcher.\nShe sells each pitcher for $6, so she makes a profit of 12-6 = $6 per pitcher.\nIf she sells all of her pitchers, she will have sold 3 pitchers, so she will have made 3*6 = $18 in profit.\nIf she spends $18 to buy supplies and makes a profit of $18, then her profit per hour running the lemonade stand is 18-0 = $18.\n#### 18\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.251697931438684, "len_probs": 197, "answer": "\nMillie makes 12 cups of lemonade per pitcher and she sells each cup for $1, so she makes 12*1 = $12 per pitcher.\nShe spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, so the cost per pitcher is 18/3 = $6 per pitcher.\nShe sells each pitcher for $6, so she makes a profit of 12-6 = $6 per pitcher.\nIf she sells all of her pitchers, she will have sold 3 pitchers, so she will have made 3*6 = $18 in profit.\nIf she spends $18 to buy supplies and makes a profit of $18, then her profit per hour running the lemonade stand is 18-0 = $18.\n#### 18\n"}]}
