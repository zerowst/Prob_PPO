How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?\n\nSolution:\nJulia rowed 20 feet, and the boat took on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed. So, for 20 feet Julia\u2019s boat took on 20/10 * 2 = 4 liters of water.\nThe boat took on water at a rate of 4 liters per 10 feet, so it took on 4/10 * 16 = 8 liters of water in the first 16 seconds.\nThe shore was 64 seconds away, so Julia\u2019s boat took on 64-16 = 48 seconds.\nJulia\u2019s boat took on 8 liters of water in the first 16 seconds, so in the next 48 seconds it took on an additional 48 * (2/10) * 2 = 24 liters of water.\nThus, in the first 64 seconds, the boat took on 8 + 24 = 32 liters of water.\n#### 32\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.129360899329185, "len_probs": 230, "answer": "\nJulia rowed 20 feet, and the boat took on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed.
