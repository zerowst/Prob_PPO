She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?\n\nSolution:\nShe paid $2 for two packs of strawberry gum, so she got 2 * $2 = $4 for strawberry gum.\nShe also paid $7 - $4 = $3 for the small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much for, so she paid $3 / 2 = $1.50 for the green apple gum.\nSo she paid $2 + $1.50 + $3 = $6 for all the gum she bought, and she bought 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 packs of gum in total, so each pack of strawberry gum cost  $7 - 6 = $1.\nTherefore, she paid $1 for each pack of strawberry gum.\n#### 1\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.218447223305702, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nShe paid $2 for two packs of strawberry gum, so she got 2 * $2 = $4 for strawberry gum.\nShe also paid $7 - $4 = $3 for the small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much for, so she paid $3 / 2 = $1.50 for the green apple gum.\nSo she paid $2 + $1.50 + $3 = $6 for all the gum she bought, and she bought 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 packs of gum in total, so each pack of strawberry gum cost  $7 - 6 = $1.\nTherefore, she paid $1 for each pack of strawberry gum.\n#### 1\n"}, {"text": "\nLet x be the amount Suzie paid for each pack of strawberry gum.\nShe bought two packs, so 2 * x = $2.\nShe also bought a pack of grape gum, so she paid x + 2 * x = $2 + $2 * x.\nShe also bought a small pack of green apple gum, so she paid x * 0.5 = $7 - (2 + 2 * x) = $7 - 2 - 2 * x.\nSince she paid $7 in all, we can write the equation: x * 0.5 + 2 * x + x = 7.\nCombining like terms, we get 2.5x = 7 - 2.\nCombining like terms again, we get 2.5x = 5.\nDividing both sides by 2.5, we get x = 5 / 2.5 = 2.\n#### 2\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.
