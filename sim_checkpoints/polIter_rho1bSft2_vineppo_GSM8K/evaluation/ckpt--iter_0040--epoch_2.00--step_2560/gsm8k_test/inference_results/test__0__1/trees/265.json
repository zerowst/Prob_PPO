How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?\n\nSolution:\nThe brokerage fee is $350 000 x 0.05 = $17500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 0.12 = $42000.\nThe total price is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $567000.\nThe difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $567000 - $400000 = $167000.\nTherefore, Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400000 and the total price of the house is $567000, so the difference is $567000 - $400000 = $167000.\n#### 167000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -10.260657273232937, "len_probs": 204, "answer": "\nThe brokerage fee is $350 000 x 0.05 = $17500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 0.12 = $42000.\nThe total price is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $567000.\nThe difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $567000 - $400000 = $167000.\nTherefore, Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400000 and the total price of the house is $567000, so the difference is $567000 - $400000 = $167000.\n#### 167000\n"}, {"text": "\nThe brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5% = $17500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 12% = $42000.\nThe total cost of buying the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $567000.\nThus, the difference between the cost of buying the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $567000 - $400000 = $167000.\nTherefore, the total price of the house is $167000 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n#### 167000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget.
