She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?\n\nSolution:\nAt her first job, Annabelle earns 20 hours * $10/hour = $200\nAt her second job, she earns 15 hours * $5/hour = $75\nSo she earns a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.\nThis means she has saved enough money to buy the phone, because 400 - 80 - 275 = 45\nTherefore, Annabelle still needs to save $400 - $45 = $355\n#### 355\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.323527798056602, "len_probs": 136, "answer": "\nAt her first job, Annabelle earns 20 hours * $10/hour = $200\nAt her second job, she earns 15 hours * $5/hour = $75\nSo she earns a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.\nThis means she has saved enough money to buy the phone, because 400 - 80 - 275 = 45\nTherefore, Annabelle still needs to save $400 - $45 = $355\n#### 355\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst job: $10/hour * 20 hours = $200\nSecond job: $5/hour * 15 hours = $75\nTotal earned from the first job: $200\nTotal earned from the second job: $75\nTotal earned: $200 + $75 = $275\nShe has $80 from her savings and has earned $275, so she needs to save $400-$80-$275=$95\n#### 95\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAnnabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400.
