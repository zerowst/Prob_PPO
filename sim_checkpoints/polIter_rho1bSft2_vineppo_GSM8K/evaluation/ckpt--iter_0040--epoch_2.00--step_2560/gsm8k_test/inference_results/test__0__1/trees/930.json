The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of toys before the tube of bouncy balls was added is 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings = 50 toys.\nIf Sophie\u2019s total number of toys is 62 after receiving the tube of bouncy balls, this means she had 50 toys before and added 62 \u2013 50 = 12 toys from the bouncy balls.\nThus, Sophie received 12 toys / (1 toy per bouncy ball) = 12 bouncy balls.\n#### 12\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.066030494868755, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nThe total number of toys before the tube of bouncy balls was added is 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings = 50 toys.\nIf Sophie\u2019s total number of toys is 62 after receiving the tube of bouncy balls, this means she had 50 toys before and added 62 \u2013 50 = 12 toys from the bouncy balls.\nThus, Sophie received 12 toys / (1 toy per bouncy ball) = 12 bouncy balls.\n#### 12\n"}]}
