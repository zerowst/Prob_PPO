How many ounces of oil does she use?\n\nSolution:\nShe uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2*2=4 ounces of oil.\nShe uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2*1=2 ounces of salt.\nShe uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so she uses 1 ounce of citrus zest.\nShe uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she uses 2 ounces of salt.\nThus she uses 2+1+2+1+2=8 ounces.\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.397043466567993, "len_probs": 129, "answer": "\nShe uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2*2=4 ounces of oil.\nShe uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2*1=2 ounces of salt.\nShe uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so she uses 1 ounce of citrus zest.\nShe uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she uses 2 ounces of salt.\nThus she uses 2+1+2+1+2=8 ounces.\n#### 8\n"}, {"text": "\nShe uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2*3=6 ounces of oil.\nShe uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2*1=2 ounces of salt.\nShe uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so she uses 1 ounce of citrus zest.\nShe uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she uses 3 ounces of sugar.\nThus, in all, she uses 6+2+1+3=12 ounces of oil.\n#### 12\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar.
