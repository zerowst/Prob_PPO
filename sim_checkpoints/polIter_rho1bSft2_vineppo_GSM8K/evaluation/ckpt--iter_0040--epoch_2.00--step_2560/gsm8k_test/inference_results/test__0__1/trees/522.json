In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?\n\nSolution:\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so he picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so she can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky can pick two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so he can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nTony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 31 quarts per hour.\nThus, they can pick 31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.18561602383852, "len_probs": 161, "answer": "\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so he picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so she can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky can pick two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so he can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nTony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 31 quarts per hour.\nThus, they can pick 31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n"}, {"text": "\nBobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so he picks at a rate of 6 quarts/hour - 1 quarts/hour = 5 quarts/hour.\nKathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so she picks at a rate of 5 quarts/hour * 2 = 10 quarts/hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than does Kathy, so he picks at a rate of 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.\nTony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick in total at a rate of 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour = 39 quarts/hour.\n#### 39\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIt's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.
