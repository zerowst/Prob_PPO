For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?\n\nSolution:\nTim needs 4 gallons of lemonade which is twice as much as the other gallons, so he needs 2 times the amount of lemons. 2 times 4 gallons is 8 gallons.\nEach gallon of lemonade uses 1 cup of juice, so 8 gallons will use 8*1 = 8 cups of juice.\nEach gallon uses 1 cup of juice, so 4 gallons will use 4*1 = 4 cups of juice.\nTim needs 4 cups of lemon juice, but his recipe only calls for 1 cup, so he needs an additional 1*6 = 6 lemons.\nHe needs 6 lemons, so he needs 4+6 = 10 lemons in total.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.693042941391468, "len_probs": 185, "answer": "\nTim needs 4 gallons of lemonade which is twice as much as the other gallons, so he needs 2 times the amount of lemons. 2 times 4 gallons is 8 gallons.\nEach gallon of lemonade uses 1 cup of juice, so 8 gallons will use 8*1 = 8 cups of juice.\nEach gallon uses 1 cup of juice, so 4 gallons will use 4*1 = 4 cups of juice.\nTim needs 4 cups of lemon juice, but his recipe only calls for 1 cup, so he needs an additional 1*6 = 6 lemons.\nHe needs 6 lemons, so he needs 4+6 = 10 lemons in total.\n#### 10\n"}, {"text": "\nTim needs 4 gallons of lemonade which is 4*1 = 4 gallons\nEach gallon of lemonade needs 1 cup of juice, so 4 gallons will need 4*1 = 4 cups of juice\nHis recipe calls for 1 cup of juice per gallon, so he will need 4 cups of juice from his regular recipe, and 6*4 = 24 lemons\nSince his best friend asked for twice as tart, he needs twice the amount of lemons, so he needs 24*2 = 48 lemons\n#### 48\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.
