How many jellyfish are in the tank?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 6 jellyfish that changed color, and this number is a third of the jellyfish that are large. If we let x be the number of jellyfish in the tank, then 1/3*x = 6.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 6*3 = 18 jellyfish in the tank.\nThe remaining 4/5 of the jellyfish are small and stay blue, so there are (4/5)*18 = 14.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a jellyfish, we round up to 15 jellyfish.\nSo there are a total of 15 + 6 = 21 jellyfish in the tank.\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.548382736742496, "len_probs": 177, "answer": "\nThere are 6 jellyfish that changed color, and this number is a third of the jellyfish that are large.
