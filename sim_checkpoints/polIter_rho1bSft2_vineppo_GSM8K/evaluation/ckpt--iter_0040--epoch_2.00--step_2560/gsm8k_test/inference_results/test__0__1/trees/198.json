After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first month, Elaine collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards.\nIn the second month, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\nThe total number of cards collected in the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.\nIn the third month, Elaine collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months, which is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.\nIn total, Elaine collected 100 + 200 = 300 cards.\nTherefore Elaine has 20 + 300 = 320 cards in her collection.\n#### 320\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.424235224723816, "len_probs": 162, "answer": "\nIn the first month, Elaine collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards.\nIn the second month, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\nThe total number of cards collected in the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.\nIn the third month, Elaine collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months, which is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.\nIn total, Elaine collected 100 + 200 = 300 cards.\nTherefore Elaine has 20 + 300 = 320 cards in her collection.\n#### 320\n"}]}
