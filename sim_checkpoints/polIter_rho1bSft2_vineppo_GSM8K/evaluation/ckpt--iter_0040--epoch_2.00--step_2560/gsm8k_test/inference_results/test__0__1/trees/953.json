Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?\n\nSolution:\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, she wakes up 6 - 10 = -4 hours late.\nThis means she was actually asleep from 10 - (-4) = 10 + 4 = 14:00 to 10 + 4 + 5 = 14:15 on that day.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am. This is a total of 2:38 - 2:15 = 13 minutes.\nSo, she was asleep for 14:15 - 2:15 = 12:00 + 10 = 12:10 hours.\nTherefore, she slept for 12:10 x 60 = 720 minutes.\n#### 720\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.037554308772087, "len_probs": 210, "answer": "\nKim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, she wakes up 6 - 10 = -4 hours late.\nThis means she was actually asleep from 10 - (-4) = 10 + 4 = 14:00 to 10 + 4 + 5 = 14:15 on that day.\nShe was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.
