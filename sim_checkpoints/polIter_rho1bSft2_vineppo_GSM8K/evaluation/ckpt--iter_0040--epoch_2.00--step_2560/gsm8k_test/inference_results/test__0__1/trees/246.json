She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?\n\nSolution:\nShe needs to spend 6*4 = 24 hours of makeup per week\nSo she is spending 24*4*5 = 480 hours of makeup per month\nThat means she is spending 480*250 = 120,000 dollars per year\nHer discount is 10% so that means she pays 120,000*.1 = 12,000 dollars less\nSo she paid 120,000-12,000 = 108,000 dollars\n#### 108,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.52737481892109, "len_probs": 145, "answer": "\nShe needs to spend 6*4 = 24 hours of makeup per week\nSo she is spending 24*4*5 = 480 hours of makeup per month\nThat means she is spending 480*250 = 120,000 dollars per year\nHer discount is 10% so that means she pays 120,000*.1 = 12,000 dollars less\nSo she paid 120,000-12,000 = 108,000 dollars\n#### 108,000\n"}, {"text": "\nThe makeup artist charges 250*6 = $1500 per day\nShe works 4 days a week so she charges 1500*4 = 6000 per week\nShe works for 5 weeks so she charges 6000*5 = 30000\nShe gets a 10% discount so she pays 30000*.1 = 3000\nShe pays 3000 for the makeup artist to do the makeup for her movie.\n#### 3000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.
