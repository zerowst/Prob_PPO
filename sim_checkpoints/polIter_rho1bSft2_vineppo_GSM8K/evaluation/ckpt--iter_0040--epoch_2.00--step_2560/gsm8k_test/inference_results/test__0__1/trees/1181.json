50)/6 + 25 = 5*(3*Wendy\u2019s age now - 50)/6 + 25 + 25.\nSimplifying, we get 3*Wendy\u2019s age now = 5*Wendy\u2019s age now - 50 + 5*25.\nSimplifying further, we get 3*Wendy\u2019s age now = 5*Wendy\u2019s age now - 50 + 125.\nCombining like terms, we get 3*Wendy\u2019s age now = 5*Wendy\u2019s age now + 75.\nSubtracting 5*Wendy\u2019s age now from both sides, we get 3*Wendy\u2019s age now - 5*Wendy\u2019s age now = 75.\nSimplifying, we get -2*Wendy\u2019s age now = 75.\nDividing both sides by -2, we get Wendy\u2019s age now = -75/2 = -37.5.\n#### 37.5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nWendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
