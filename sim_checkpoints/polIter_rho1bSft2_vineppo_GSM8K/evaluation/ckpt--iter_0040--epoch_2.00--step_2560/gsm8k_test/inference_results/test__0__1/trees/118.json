This means that there were more containers brought in on the second day.\nLet x be the number of containers brought in on the second day.\nThe total number of vehicles on the second day is 5*x, which is greater than 10.\nThis means that the number of vehicles on the second day is greater than 10, so we can write 5*x > 10.\nDividing each side by 5, we get x > 2.\nThis means that the number of containers brought in on the second day is greater than 2.\nThe only number that is greater than 2 and is a whole number is 3.\nTherefore, 3 containers were imported on the second day.\n#### 3\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.\n\nSolution:\nOn the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, for a total of 2*5 = 10 vehicles.\nThe number of vehicles on the second day is 30, which is more than the 10 that were there on the first day. This means that there were more containers brought in on the second day.\nLet x be the number of containers brought in on the second day.\nThe total number of vehicles on the second day is 5*x, which is greater than 10.\nThis means that the number of vehicles on the second day is greater than 10, so we can write 5*x > 10.\nDividing each side by 5, we get x > 2.\nThis means that the number of containers brought in on the second day is greater than 2.\nThe only number that is greater than 2 and is a whole number is 3.\nTherefore, 3 containers were imported on the second day.\n#### 3\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -28.54905404895544, "len_probs": 223, "answer": "\nOn the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, for a total of 2*5 = 10 vehicles.\nThe number of vehicles on the second day is 30, which is more than the 10 that were there on the first day.
