He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?\n\nSolution:\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nHe took 12/2=6 hours for the first part\nHe took 6/2=3 hours for the rest\nSo he took 6+3=9 hours for the first half of the trip\nHe swam at 2 miles per hour for 3 hours, so he swam 3*2=6 miles\nSo he had a total of 20-12+6=18 miles left to swim\nHe went 18/2=9 miles per hour for the last part\nSo he took 9 hours for the last part\nSo he took a total of 9+3+9=21 hours\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.699655652046204, "len_probs": 160, "answer": "\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nHe took 12/2=6 hours for the first part\nHe took 6/2=3 hours for the rest\nSo he took 6+3=9 hours for the first half of the trip\nHe swam at 2 miles per hour for 3 hours, so he swam 3*2=6 miles\nSo he had a total of 20-12+6=18 miles left to swim\nHe went 18/2=9 miles per hour for the last part\nSo he took 9 hours for the last part\nSo he took a total of 9+3+9=21 hours\n#### 21\n"}]}
