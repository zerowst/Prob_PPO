We need to find the distance Bob is driving, so we subtract his head start from the total distance he needs to cover. 75 miles - 70 miles = 5 miles\nNow we can plug in the values for r (rate) and t (time) into the formula to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob. 5 miles / 70 miles/hour = 1/14 hour\nWe can convert this time into minutes by multiplying by 60, so we get 1/14 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 5 minutes\n#### 5\n"}, {"text": "\nWe can find how long it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob by setting up a ratio of their speeds. We know that Bob is driving 55 mph and Tom is driving 70 mph, and we want to find out how long it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob, so we need to find a ratio of their distances traveled.\n\nSince Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can say that Tom has to travel 75 miles to catch up to Bob. We can also say that Tom's distance traveled is equal to his rate times the time it takes for him to catch up to Bob, or 70 mph * t hours = 75 miles.\n\nNow we can solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 70 mph, so 70 mph * t hours = 75 miles, t hours = 75 miles / 70 mph = 1.14 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom 1.14 hours to catch up to Bob.\n#### 1.14\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour.
