He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the difference in typing speed between the two tests: 52 WPM - 47 WPM = 5 WPM\nThen find how much Jared's typing speed increased on the third test: 5 words / 1 minute = 5 WPM\nAdd that to his first test speed to find his new typing speed: 5 WPM + 47 WPM = 52 WPM\nNow add the three measurements together and divide by 3 to find the average: (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 5 WPM) / 3 = 50 WPM / 3 = 16.67 WPM\n#### 16.67\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.117913126945496, "len_probs": 154, "answer": "\nFirst find the difference in typing speed between the two tests: 52 WPM - 47 WPM = 5 WPM\nThen find how much Jared's typing speed increased on the third test: 5 words / 1 minute = 5 WPM\nAdd that to his first test speed to find his new typing speed: 5 WPM + 47 WPM = 52 WPM\nNow add the three measurements together and divide by 3 to find the average: (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 5 WPM) / 3 = 50 WPM / 3 = 16.67 WPM\n#### 16.67\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first test was 47 WPM, and after the increase it became 52 WPM, so the increase was 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.\nThe second test was 52 WPM, and after the increase he became 57 WPM, so the increase was 57 - 52 = 5 WPM.\nThe third test was 57 WPM, and after the increase he became 62 WPM, so the increase was 62 - 57 = 5 WPM.\nThe three measurements are 47, 52, and 57.
