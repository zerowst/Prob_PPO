Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe second plane flies 1/4 * 2 * 3 = 2 trips to France.\nThus the first plane flies 3 + 2 = 5 trips.\nSo the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips to Poland, making it the second most popular destination.\nThe first plane takes 2 * 2 = 4 flights to France, making it the third most popular destination.\n#### 4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.67014244571328, "len_probs": 104, "answer": "\nThe second plane flies 1/4 * 2 * 3 = 2 trips to France.\nThus the first plane flies 3 + 2 = 5 trips.\nSo the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips to Poland, making it the second most popular destination.\nThe first plane takes 2 * 2 = 4 flights to France, making it the third most popular destination.\n#### 4\n"}, {"text": "\nThe second plane flies 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 flights a day.\nThe first plane flies 1.5 * 2 = 3 flights in total, which are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so it takes 3/2 = 1.5 flights to France.\nSo the first plane takes a total of 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 flights a day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes 44 / 2 = 22 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.\nThis means the first plane takes 22 * 2 = 44 trips in total throughout the day.\nTherefore the first plane takes 44 - 1.5 = 42.5 flights to France in one day.\n#### 42.5\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
