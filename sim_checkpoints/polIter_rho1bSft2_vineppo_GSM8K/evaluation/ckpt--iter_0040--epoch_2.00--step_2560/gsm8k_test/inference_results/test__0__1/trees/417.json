In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 days * 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next day, he didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.\nOn the second week, he traveled 7 days * 300 kilometers/day = 2100 kilometers.\nSo in total, Tom made 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.\n#### 3140\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.392830312252045, "len_probs": 163, "answer": "\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 days * 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next day, he didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.\nOn the second week, he traveled 7 days * 300 kilometers/day = 2100 kilometers.\nSo in total, Tom made 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.\n#### 3140\n"}, {"text": "\nDuring the first 4 days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nOver the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.\nOn the next day, he didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.\nAdding all the distances together, we get 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 2940 kilometers\n#### 2940\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
