If Matt has reached 220 steps above the entrance, how many steps will Tom have gone up by that time?\n\nSolution:\nMatt goes 20 steps per minute. If he reaches 220 steps above the entrance, he has been walking for 220 / 20 = 11 minutes.\nTom goes 5 steps per minute more than Matt, so he goes 20 + 5 = 25 steps per minute.\nIf Matt has been walking for 11 minutes, then Tom has been walking for 11 + t, where t is the number of minutes after Matt has started.\nSo the total number of steps Tom has gone up is 25 * (11 + t) = 275 + 25t.\nWe want this to be equal to 220, so we set it equal to 220 and solve for t:\n275 + 25t = 220\n25t = 55\nt = 55 / 25 = 2.2\nSo it will take Tom another 2.2 minutes after Matt to have walked 275 + 25*2.2 = 550 steps.\n#### 550\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.020337499678135, "len_probs": 249, "answer": "\nMatt goes 20 steps per minute.
