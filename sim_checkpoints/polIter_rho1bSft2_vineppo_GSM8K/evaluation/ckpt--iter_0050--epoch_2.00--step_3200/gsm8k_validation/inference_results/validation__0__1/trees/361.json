He wants to buy 5 kilograms of apples, 3 packs of sugar, and 500 grams of walnuts. One kilogram of apples costs $2, and one kilogram of walnuts costs $6. One pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than one kilogram of apples. How much Fabian needs to pay for the items he wants to buy?\n\nSolution:\nFive kilograms of apples cost 5 * $2 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost 3 * ($2 - $1) = $2.\nSo Fabian has to pay 10 + 2 + 500 grams = $10.50 + 500 grams.\nOne kilogram of walnuts is 6 dollars.\nSo Fabian has to pay 500 grams * (6 dollars / 1000 grams) = $0.30.\nTherefore Fabian needs to pay in total 10.50 + 0.30 = $10.80.\n#### 10.80\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.033940762281418, "len_probs": 161, "answer": "\nFive kilograms of apples cost 5 * $2 = $10.\nThree packs of sugar cost 3 * ($2 - $1) = $2.\nSo Fabian has to pay 10 + 2 + 500 grams = $10.50 + 500 grams.\nOne kilogram of walnuts is 6 dollars.\nSo Fabian has to pay 500 grams * (6 dollars / 1000 grams) = $0.30.\nTherefore Fabian needs to pay in total 10.50 + 0.30 = $10.80.\n#### 10.80\n"}]}
