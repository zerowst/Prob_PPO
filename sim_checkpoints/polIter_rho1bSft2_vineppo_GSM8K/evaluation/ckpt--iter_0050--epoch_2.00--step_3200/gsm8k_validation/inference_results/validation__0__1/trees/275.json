A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?\n\nSolution:\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models.\nAltogether, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe museum price is $100, so the total cost without discount is 6 x $100 = $600.\nThere was a 5% discount for each model, so 600 x 0.05 = $30 was deducted from the total cost.\nThus, the final cost after the discount is $600 - $30 = $570.\nThe school paid in all after the discount was applied.\n#### 570\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.729128651320934, "len_probs": 161, "answer": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library, so 2 x 2 = 4 models.\nAltogether, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nThe museum price is $100, so the total cost without discount is 6 x $100 = $600.\nThere was a 5% discount for each model, so 600 x 0.05 = $30 was deducted from the total cost.\nThus, the final cost after the discount is $600 - $30 = $570.\nThe school paid in all after the discount was applied.\n#### 570\n"}, {"text": "\nThe school bought twice as many dinosaur models for the elementary library, so they bought 2 * 2 = 4 models.\nIn total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 dinosaur models.\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.\nThe reduction price for each model is $100 * 0.05 = $5.\nSo the school paid $100 - $5 = $95 for each model for the kindergarten library.\nTherefore, the total cost for the kindergarten library models is 6 * $95 = $570.\nAnd the total cost for the elementary library models is 4 * $95 = $380.\nTherefore, the total cost for all the dinosaur models is $570 + $380 = $950.\n#### 950\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nThe Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each.
