There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nSolution:\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach machine therefore must have a total of 90 dollars / 180 coins / machine = 0.5 dollars per coin, to make a total of 180 coins.\nThis means there are a total of 0.5 dollars / coin = 50 quarters in the launderette, and 50 quarters + 100 dimes = 150 coins in all, since there were 100 dimes in each machine.\nSo the total number of machines in the launderette is 150 coins / 80 coins / machine = 1.875 machines, but since Erin can't have a fraction of a machine, she must have 2 machines.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.406493559479713, "len_probs": 216, "answer": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 coins.\nEach machine therefore must have a total of 90 dollars / 180 coins / machine = 0.5 dollars per coin, to make a total of 180 coins.\nThis means there are a total of 0.5 dollars / coin = 50 quarters in the launderette, and 50 quarters + 100 dimes = 150 coins in all, since there were 100 dimes in each machine.\nSo the total number of machines in the launderette is 150 coins / 80 coins / machine = 1.875 machines, but since Erin can't have a fraction of a machine, she must have 2 machines.\n#### 2\n"}, {"text": "\nThere are 80 quarters in a machine, and 100 dimes in a machine, so each machine holds 80 quarters + 100 dimes = 180 cents.\nEach machine therefore holds 180 cents / (10 cents/quarter + 10 cents/dime) = 180 cents / 20 cents/machine = 9 machines.\nErin emptied all of the machines, so she must have started with 9 machines * $0.18/machine = $1.8.\nAfter she emptied the machines, she had a total of $90, so she must have had $90 - $1.8 = $88.\nTherefore, Erin had to empty 88 / 9 machines = 9.68, which rounds up to 10 machines in the launderette.\n#### 10\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nErin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines.
