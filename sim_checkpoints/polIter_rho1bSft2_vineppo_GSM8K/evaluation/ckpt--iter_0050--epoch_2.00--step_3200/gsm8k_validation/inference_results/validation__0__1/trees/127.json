If he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, how many weeks will it take him to only drink 6 sodas per week?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total number of sodas Jerry drinks after 1 week: 48 sodas / 2 = 24 sodas\nThen find the total number of sodas after 2 weeks: 24 sodas / 2 = 12 sodas\nThen find the total number of sodas after 3 weeks: 12 sodas / 2 = 6 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 4 weeks: 6 sodas / 2 = 3 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 5 weeks: 3 sodas / 2 = 1.5 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 6 weeks: 1.5 sodas / 2 = 0.75 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 6 weeks is 0.75 sodas, so it will take him 6 weeks to only drink 6 sodas per week.\n#### 6\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -8.057658106088638, "len_probs": 213, "answer": "\nFirst find the total number of sodas Jerry drinks after 1 week: 48 sodas / 2 = 24 sodas\nThen find the total number of sodas after 2 weeks: 24 sodas / 2 = 12 sodas\nThen find the total number of sodas after 3 weeks: 12 sodas / 2 = 6 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 4 weeks: 6 sodas / 2 = 3 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 5 weeks: 3 sodas / 2 = 1.5 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 6 weeks: 1.5 sodas / 2 = 0.75 sodas\nThen the total number of sodas after 6 weeks is 0.75 sodas, so it will take him 6 weeks to only drink 6 sodas per week.\n#### 6\n"}, {"text": "\nJerry starts by drinking 48 sodas a week.
