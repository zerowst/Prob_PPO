Each cat has a collar decorated with gemstones.  Binkie has four times as many gemstones on his collar as does Frankie but Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does Frankie.  If Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, how many gemstones does Binkie have on his collar?\n\nSolution:\nIf Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, then half as many as Frankie is 1/2*Frankie's gemstones = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then half as many as Frankie is 1/2*x = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 4*x = 4*(Frankie's gemstones / 2) = 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 4*(Frankie's gemstones / 2) = 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nBinkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nBinkie has 2*x = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nBinkie has 2*4 = 8\nBinkie has 8\n#### 8\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.281565248966217, "len_probs": 452, "answer": "\nIf Spaatz has 1 Gemstone on her collar, then half as many as Frankie is 1/2*Frankie's gemstones = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then half as many as Frankie is 1/2*x = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 4*x = 4*(Frankie's gemstones / 2) = 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 4*(Frankie's gemstones / 2) = 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nIf Frankie has x Gemstones on her collar, then Binkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nBinkie has 2*Frankie's gemstones / 4 = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nBinkie has 2*x = Frankie's gemstones / 2\nBinkie has 2*4 = 8\nBinkie has 8\n#### 8\n"}]}
