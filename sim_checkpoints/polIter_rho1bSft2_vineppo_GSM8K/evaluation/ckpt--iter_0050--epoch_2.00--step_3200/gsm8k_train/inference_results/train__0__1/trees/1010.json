Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?\n\nSolution:\nThere were 90 x 2/3 = 60 students who sat at the cafeteria.\nThere were 90 - 60 = 30 students outside who were left after the students inside left.\nThen 30 x 1/3 = 10 students ran inside from the outside to the cafeteria.\nThere were 90 - 3 + 10 = 77 students inside after 3 left outside.\nBut 3 students ran out again, so the final number of students is 77 - 3 = 74.\n#### 74\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.028756760060787, "len_probs": 136, "answer": "\nThere were 90 x 2/3 = 60 students who sat at the cafeteria.\nThere were 90 - 60 = 30 students outside who were left after the students inside left.\nThen 30 x 1/3 = 10 students ran inside from the outside to the cafeteria.\nThere were 90 - 3 + 10 = 77 students inside after 3 left outside.\nBut 3 students ran out again, so the final number of students is 77 - 3 = 74.\n#### 74\n"}]}
