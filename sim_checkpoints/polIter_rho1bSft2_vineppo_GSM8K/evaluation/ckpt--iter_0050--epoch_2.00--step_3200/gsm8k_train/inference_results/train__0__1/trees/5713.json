The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\n\nSolution:\n20% of the computers John had to fix were unfixable. That is 20/100 * 20 = 4 computers.\nThat means, John was able to fix 20 - 4 = 16 computers.\nBut John was also able to fix some computers that needed to wait a few days for spare parts. That's 40% of the remaining computers.\nSo, John was able to fix the rest of the computers that needed to wait, which is 16 - (40/100 * 16) = 16 - 6 = 10 computers.\nSo, John was able to fix 10 computers out of the 20 he had to fix.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -32.25097734108567, "len_probs": 167, "answer": "\n20% of the computers John had to fix were unfixable.
