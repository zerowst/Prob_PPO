Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?\n\nSolution:\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  In total, each cylindrical structure has 12 + 7 + (number of kitchens) = 29 + (number of kitchens) rooms.\nSince there are three identical cylindrical structures, the total number of rooms in the entire space station is 3*(29 + (number of kitchens)) = 87 + 3*(number of kitchens).\nThus, the number of kitchens in the entire space station is 72 - (87 + 3*(number of kitchens)).\nThus, the number of kitchens is 72 - (87 + 3*(number of kitchens)) = -14 + 3*(number of kitchens).\nThus, the number of kitchens is 3*(number of kitchens) - 14 = 3*kitchens - 14.\nTherefore, the number of kitchens is 14 more than three times the number of kitchens.\nTherefore, the number of kitchens is 14 more than 3 times the number of kitchens, so the number of kitchens is 14.\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.487978041172028, "len_probs": 292, "answer": "\nEach cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.
