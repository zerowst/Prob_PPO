What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?\n\nSolution:\nThe larger box costs $4.80, which is equal to 4.80*100 cents = 480 cents.\nThe smaller box costs $3.40, which is equal to 3.40*100 cents = 340 cents.\nThe smaller box has a lower price per ounce, so it is the better value.\nThe smaller box is the better value because it has a lower price per ounce.\nThe price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value is 340 cents.\n#### 340\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.161838203668594, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nThe larger box costs $4.80, which is equal to 4.80*100 cents = 480 cents.\nThe smaller box costs $3.40, which is equal to 3.40*100 cents = 340 cents.\nThe smaller box has a lower price per ounce, so it is the better value.\nThe smaller box is the better value because it has a lower price per ounce.\nThe price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value is 340 cents.\n#### 340\n"}, {"text": "\nThe larger box costs $4.80 and has a volume of 30 ounces, so the price per ounce is $4.80 / 30 = $0.16 per ounce.\nThe smaller box costs $3.40 and has a volume of 20 ounces, so the price per ounce is $3.40 / 20 = $0.17 per ounce.\nThe smaller box has a better value because $0.17 per ounce < $0.16 per ounce.\nConverting $0.17 per ounce to cents, we get 0.17 * 100 = 17 cents.\nSo the answer is 17.\n#### 17\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nOliver is trying to decide between two different sized boxes of macaroni and cheese.
