In hours, how long did it take for the elevator to reach the bottom?\n\nSolution:\nThe elevator traveled down the first 10 floors in 15 minutes, so it traveled 10 floors in 15 / 5 = 3 hours.\nThe elevator traveled down the next 5 floors in 5 minutes per floor, so it took 5 * 5 = 25 minutes.\nThe elevator traveled down the final 5 floors in 16 minutes per floor, so it took 5 * 16 = 80 minutes.\nIn total, it took 3 + 25 + 80 = 128 minutes to travel down 20 floors.\nThus, in hours, it took to travel down 20 floors is 128 / 60 = 2.083 hours.\n#### 2.083\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.27184124290943, "len_probs": 191, "answer": "\nThe elevator traveled down the first 10 floors in 15 minutes, so it traveled 10 floors in 15 / 5 = 3 hours.\nThe elevator traveled down the next 5 floors in 5 minutes per floor, so it took 5 * 5 = 25 minutes.\nThe elevator traveled down the final 5 floors in 16 minutes per floor, so it took 5 * 16 = 80 minutes.\nIn total, it took 3 + 25 + 80 = 128 minutes to travel down 20 floors.\nThus, in hours, it took to travel down 20 floors is 128 / 60 = 2.083 hours.\n#### 2.083\n"}, {"text": "\nThe elevator traveled down the first half of the floors in 15/2=7.5 minutes\nIt took 5*5=25 minutes to travel the next 5 floors.\nIt took 16*5=80 minutes to travel the final 5 floors.\nIn total it took 7.5+25+80=122.5 minutes to travel down 20 floors.\nThis is equal to 122.5/60=2.04 hours.\nSo the total time in hours for the elevator to reach the bottom floor is 2.04+15/60+5/60=2.04+0.083+0.083=2.123 hours.\n#### 2.123\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMichael is stuck in an elevator that is slowly moving to the bottom floor.
