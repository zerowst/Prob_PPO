He gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs of marbles, Neil received 1/8 of the number of packs of marbles, and he kept the rest. How many packs of marbles did Leo keep?\n\nSolution:\nLeo had 400 marbles in a jar. He packed the marbles with ten marbles in each pack, and he had 400/10=40 packs of marbles.\nLeo gave Manny 1/4*40=10 packs of marbles.\nNeil received 1/8*40=5 packs of marbles from Leo.\nLeo was left with 40-10-5 = 15 packs of marbles he kept.\nSo Leo kept 15 out of the total packs of marbles he originally had, which is 400.\nTherefore, the total number of packs Leo kept is 400/15 = 26.666666666666668\nSince Leo cannot keep a fraction of a pack, he kept 26 packs.\n#### 26\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.701779417693615, "len_probs": 209, "answer": "\nLeo had 400 marbles in a jar.
