Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?\n\nSolution:\nBess throws the Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters = 80 meters.\nBess throws the Frisbee back 5 times * 20 meters = 100 meters.\nThe total distance traveled by Bess's Frisbees is 80 + 100 = 180 meters.\nHolly's Frisbees have a total distance of 5 * 8 meters = 40 meters.\nTogether, the total distance the Frisbees have traveled is 180 + 40 = 220 meters.\n#### 220\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -9.612317115068436, "len_probs": 146, "answer": "\nBess throws the Frisbee 4 times * 20 meters = 80 meters.\nBess throws the Frisbee back 5 times * 20 meters = 100 meters.\nThe total distance traveled by Bess's Frisbees is 80 + 100 = 180 meters.\nHolly's Frisbees have a total distance of 5 * 8 meters = 40 meters.\nTogether, the total distance the Frisbees have traveled is 180 + 40 = 220 meters.\n#### 220\n"}]}
