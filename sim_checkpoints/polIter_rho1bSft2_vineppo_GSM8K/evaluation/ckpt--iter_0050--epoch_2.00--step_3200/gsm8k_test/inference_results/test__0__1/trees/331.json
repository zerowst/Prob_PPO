How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total tax for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours * .2 = $6000\nThen subtract that amount from Job A's gross pay to find Job A's net pay: $42,000 - $6000 = $36,000\nThen find the net pay after taxes for Job B: $42,000 + $6,000 (property tax) - $10,000 (10% tax on net income) = $36,000\nThen subtract Job A's net pay from Job B's net pay to find the difference: $36,000 - $36,000 = 0\nSo the answer is 0\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.007076792418957, "len_probs": 181, "answer": "\nFirst find the total tax for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours * .2 = $6000\nThen subtract that amount from Job A's gross pay to find Job A's net pay: $42,000 - $6000 = $36,000\nThen find the net pay after taxes for Job B: $42,000 + $6,000 (property tax) - $10,000 (10% tax on net income) = $36,000\nThen subtract Job A's net pay from Job B's net pay to find the difference: $36,000 - $36,000 = 0\nSo the answer is 0\n#### 0\n"}, {"text": "\nFirst find the total tax for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours * .2 = $6,000\nThen subtract that amount from Job A's gross pay to find Job A's net pay: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000\nNext find the net pay for Job B after taxes: $42,000 + (6,000 / 100) * 10% = $42,000 + $420 = $42,420\nThen subtract Job B's net pay from Job A's net pay to find the difference: $36,000 - $42,420 = -$6,420\nSo Nick would make $6,420 more per year at Job A, which pays $15 an hour, if he chose that job over Job B.\n#### 6420\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nNick is choosing between two jobs.
