If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?\n\nSolution:\nDuring the weekdays of a week, there are 5 days. So, in 4 weeks, there are 5*4 = 20 weekdays.\nThus, there are 20*60 = 1,200 chairs rented out during weekdays.\nDuring the weekends of a week, there are 2 days. So, in 4 weeks, there are 2*4 = 8 weekends.\nThus, there are 8*100 = 800 chairs rented out during weekends.\nTherefore, the total number of chairs rented out is 1,200 + 800 = 2,000 chairs.\nTherefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 2,000 chairs in 4 weeks * 2 months = 800 chairs.\n#### 800\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.6636061668396, "len_probs": 207, "answer": "\nDuring the weekdays of a week, there are 5 days.
