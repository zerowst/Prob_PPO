In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?\n\nSolution:\nTony can pick 6 quarts per hour.\nBobby can pick 6 quarts per hour minus 1 quart per hour, so he can pick 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many as Bobby, so she can pick 2*5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky can pick two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so he can pick 10-2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nAdding all four of their quarts per hour together, we get 6+5+10+8 = 31 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, together they can pick 31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.846971590071917, "len_probs": 158, "answer": "\nTony can pick 6 quarts per hour.\nBobby can pick 6 quarts per hour minus 1 quart per hour, so he can pick 5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many as Bobby, so she can pick 2*5 = 10 quarts per hour.\nRicky can pick two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so he can pick 10-2 = 8 quarts per hour.\nAdding all four of their quarts per hour together, we get 6+5+10+8 = 31 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, together they can pick 31 quarts per hour.\n#### 31\n"}, {"text": "\nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, who picks 6 quarts per hour, so Bobby picks 6-1=5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, who picks 5 quarts per hour, so Kathy can pick 2*5=10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, who can pick 10 quarts per hour, so Ricky can pick 10-2=8 quarts per hour.\nAdding the quarts each person can pick per hour, we get 6+5+10+8=30 quarts per hour.\nTherefore, together they can pick 30 quarts per hour.\n#### 30\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nIt's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.
