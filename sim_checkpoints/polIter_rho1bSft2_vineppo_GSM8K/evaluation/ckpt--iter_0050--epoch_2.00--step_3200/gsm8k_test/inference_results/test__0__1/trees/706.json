Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first 3 hours, they raised a total of $2100.\nThey need to raise an additional $6300-$2100 = $4200.\nThe total amount they will raise in the remaining hours is $4200/the amount raised per hour = 4200/x\nThey have to raise this amount in the remaining hours.\nThe total amount they will raise in the remaining hours is also equal to the total amount they have raised so far (the amount raised in the first 3 hours) + the amount they raise in the remaining hours = $2100 + the amount they raise in the remaining hours = $4200\nTherefore, the amount they raise in the remaining hours = $4200- $2100 = $2100\nThey raised an equal amount each hour for the remaining hours, so they raised $2100/the amount raised per hour = the number of hours = 2100/x\nThe number of hours is the same as the number of hours it takes to raise the remaining amount,
