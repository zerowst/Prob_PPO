He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the second week, Boris produces 8,000 * 1/2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the third week, Boris produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.\nSo, the total number of bars Boris produces in the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 32,000 bars of chocolate.\nTherefore, Boris produces 50,000 - 32,000 = 18,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.\nSo, Boris produces 18,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.\n#### 18,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -11.383266068994999, "len_probs": 212, "answer": "\nIn the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the second week, Boris produces 8,000 * 1/2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the third week, Boris produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.\nSo, the total number of bars Boris produces in the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 32,000 bars of chocolate.\nTherefore, Boris produces 50,000 - 32,000 = 18,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.\nSo, Boris produces 18,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.\n#### 18,000\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the second week, Boris produces 8000/2 = 4000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the third week, Boris produces 8000 x 3 = 24000 bars of chocolate.\nThe total from the first 3 weeks is 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36400.\nThe total for the fourth week is 50000 - 36400 = 13600.\nBoris produces 13600 bars of chocolate the fourth week.\n#### 13600\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nBoris owns a chocolate factory.
