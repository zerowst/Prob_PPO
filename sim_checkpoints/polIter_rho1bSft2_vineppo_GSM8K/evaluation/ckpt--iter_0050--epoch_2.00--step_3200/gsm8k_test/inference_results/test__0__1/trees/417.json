How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nIn the next two days, he traveled a total of (30% of 800) * 2 = 480 kilometers.\nOn the last day of his trip, Tom traveled 300 kilometers.\nThus, in the first two weeks of his trip, Tom traveled 800 + 480 + 300 = 1580 kilometers.\n#### 1580\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.495693519711494, "len_probs": 130, "answer": "\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nIn the next two days, he traveled a total of (30% of 800) * 2 = 480 kilometers.\nOn the last day of his trip, Tom traveled 300 kilometers.\nThus, in the first two weeks of his trip, Tom traveled 800 + 480 + 300 = 1580 kilometers.\n#### 1580\n"}, {"text": "\nIn the first four days, Tom traveled 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.\nIn the next two days, he traveled only 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.\nThe total distance for the first half of the trip is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.\nThe second week he traveled 300 kilometers every day for a total of 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.\nIn total Tom traveled 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers during his trip.\n#### 3140\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
