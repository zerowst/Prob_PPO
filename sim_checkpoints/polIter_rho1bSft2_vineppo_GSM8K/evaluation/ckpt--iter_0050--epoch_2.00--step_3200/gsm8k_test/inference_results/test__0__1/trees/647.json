So, he can dig 24 feet of soil in 24 / 4 = 6 hours.\nBill can dig through clay at half the rate of soil, so he can dig through clay at 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour.\nSo, he can dig 8 feet of clay in 8 / 2 = 4 hours.\nThus, he can dig the well through soil and clay in 6 + 4 = 10 hours.\nTherefore, the total time taken to dig the well is 10 hours.\nThe total time taken to dig the well is 10 hours.\n#### 10\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.591436743736267, "len_probs": 164, "answer": "\nBill can dig through soil at a rate of 4 feet/hour.
