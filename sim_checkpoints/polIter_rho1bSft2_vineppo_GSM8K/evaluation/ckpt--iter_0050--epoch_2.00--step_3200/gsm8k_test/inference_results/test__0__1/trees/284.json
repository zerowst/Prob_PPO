If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether.\n\nSolution:\nIn the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories, for a total of 20+40+60 = 120 stories.\nIf they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, Alani wrote 2*20 = 40 stories in the second week.\nBraylen wrote 2*40 = 80 stories in the second week.\nMargot wrote 2*60 = 120 stories in the second week.\nIn the first week of the second week, Alani wrote 40 stories, Braylen wrote 80 stories, and Margot wrote 120 stories, for a total of 40+80+120 = 240 stories.\nIn the first week of the second week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, Alani wrote 20 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories, for a total of 40+20+60 = 120 stories.\nIn the first week of the second week, Margot wrote 60 stories, Alani wrote 40 stories, and Braylen wrote 80 stories, for a total of 60+40+80 = 180 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, Alani wrote 120+180 = 300 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, Braylen wrote 120+80 = 200 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, Margot wrote 60+80 = 140 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, they wrote 300+200+140 = 640 stories.\nAltogether after the second week, they wrote 640 stories.\n#### 640\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.9159811809659, "len_probs": 437, "answer": "\nIn the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories, for a total of 20+40+60 = 120 stories.\nIf they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, Alani wrote 2*20 = 40 stories in the second week.\nBraylen wrote 2*40 = 80 stories in the second week.\nMargot wrote 2*60 = 120 stories in the second week.\nIn the first week of the second week, Alani wrote 40 stories, Braylen wrote 80 stories, and Margot wrote 120 stories, for a total of 40+80+120 = 240 stories.\nIn the first week of the second week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, Alani wrote 20 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories, for a total of 40+20+60 = 120 stories.\nIn the first week of the second week, Margot wrote 60 stories, Alani wrote 40 stories, and Braylen wrote 80 stories, for a total of 60+40+80 = 180 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, Alani wrote 120+180 = 300 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, Braylen wrote 120+80 = 200 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, Margot wrote 60+80 = 140 stories.\nAltogether in the first two weeks, they wrote 300+200+140 = 640 stories.\nAltogether after the second week, they wrote 640 stories.\n#### 640\n"}]}
