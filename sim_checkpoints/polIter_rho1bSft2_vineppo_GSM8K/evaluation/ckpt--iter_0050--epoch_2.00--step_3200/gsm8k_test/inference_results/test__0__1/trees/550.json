How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?\n\nSolution:\nThe five notebooks cost 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.\nThe two pens cost 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.\nThe calculator costs $12.\nAnd the geometry set costs $10.\nSo the total amount Daniel has to pay without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.\nDaniel will get a discount of 10% on all the items, so the discount will be $30 * 0.10 = $3.\nSo Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $27.\nTherefore, Daniel has to pay $27.\n#### 27\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.54656432941556, "len_probs": 171, "answer": "\nThe five notebooks cost 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.\nThe two pens cost 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.\nThe calculator costs $12.\nAnd the geometry set costs $10.\nSo the total amount Daniel has to pay without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.\nDaniel will get a discount of 10% on all the items, so the discount will be $30 * 0.10 = $3.\nSo Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $27.\nTherefore, Daniel has to pay $27.\n#### 27\n"}, {"text": "\nThe cost of five notebooks is $1.50 x 5 = $7.50.\nThe cost of two pens is $0.25 x 2 = $0.50.\nThe cost of one calculator is $12.00.\nThe cost of one geometry set is $10.00.\nThe total amount that Daniel has to spend before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.\nThe discount on the total amount is 10% of $30.00, which is $30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00.\nSo, the total amount Daniel has to spend after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.\n#### 27\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA shop sells school supplies.
