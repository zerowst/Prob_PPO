If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total cost of the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75.\nThen subtract the cost of fixing the pothole and the cost of the asphalt from the total cost to find Ron's net savings: $75 - $120 - $450 = -$425\nRon will save $425 from fixing the pothole.\n#### 425\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -12.945383071899414, "len_probs": 102, "answer": "\nFirst find the total cost of the asphalt: $25/bucket * 3 buckets = $75.\nThen subtract the cost of fixing the pothole and the cost of the asphalt from the total cost to find Ron's net savings: $75 - $120 - $450 = -$425\nRon will save $425 from fixing the pothole.\n#### 425\n"}]}
