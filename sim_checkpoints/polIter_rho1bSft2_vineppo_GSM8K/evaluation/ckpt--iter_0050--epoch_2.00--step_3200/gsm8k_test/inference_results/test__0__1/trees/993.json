The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?\n\nSolution:\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the second plane goes to France on 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 flights, which is not possible, so it must be 0 flights.\nSo the first plane goes to France for 2 - 0 = 2 flights.\nThe second plane goes to France on 44 trips / 2 = 22 trips.\nSo the first plane takes in the morning 2 flights + 22 flights = 24 flights.\nTherefore the first plane takes 24 flights in the morning on one day.\n#### 24\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.68019860982895, "len_probs": 171, "answer": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 * 2 = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the second plane goes to France on 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 flights, which is not possible, so it must be 0 flights.\nSo the first plane goes to France for 2 - 0 = 2 flights.\nThe second plane goes to France on 44 trips / 2 = 22 trips.\nSo the first plane takes in the morning 2 flights + 22 flights = 24 flights.\nTherefore the first plane takes 24 flights in the morning on one day.\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nThe first plane goes to Greece for 3 / 4 * 2 = 1.5 flights.\nThe remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, so the second plane goes to France on 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 flights.\nThus, the first plane takes a total of 1.5 + 0.75 = 2.25 flights per day.\nSince the second plane flies exclusively to Poland, it takes the second plane 44 / 2 = 22 trips per day.\nTherefore, the first plane takes the second plane's 22 trips in total, which is its flights to France, so the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in one day.\n#### 11\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day.
