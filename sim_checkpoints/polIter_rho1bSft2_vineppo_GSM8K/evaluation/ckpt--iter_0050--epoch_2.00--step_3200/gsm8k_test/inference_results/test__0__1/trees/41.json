Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?\n\nSolution:\nWhen Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nTherefore, she could stand outside the dragon's reach for 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet, which is not possible.\nSo, when Polly held the gemstone, she could throw the javelin 400 feet.\nTherefore, Polly could stand outside the dragon's reach for 1000 - 400 = 600 feet.\n#### 600\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.823679715394974, "len_probs": 137, "answer": "\nWhen Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.\nTherefore, she could stand outside the dragon's reach for 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet, which is not possible.\nSo, when Polly held the gemstone, she could throw the javelin 400 feet.\nTherefore, Polly could stand outside the dragon's reach for 1000 - 400 = 600 feet.\n#### 600\n"}]}
