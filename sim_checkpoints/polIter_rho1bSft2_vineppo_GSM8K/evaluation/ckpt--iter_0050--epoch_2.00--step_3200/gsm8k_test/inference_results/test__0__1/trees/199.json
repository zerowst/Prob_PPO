He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?\n\nSolution:\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays Mark 5*2 = 10 cents per sentence.\nMark edits 1000 sentences each week, so if Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, he earns 1000*5 = 5000 cents from Publisher A in one week.\nSince Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence, he earns 1000*10 = 10000 cents from Publisher B in one week.\nIn total, Mark makes 10000+5000 = 15000 cents in a week from both publishers.\nTherefore, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week from his work.\n#### 15000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.51664337515831, "len_probs": 205, "answer": "\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays Mark 5*2 = 10 cents per sentence.\nMark edits 1000 sentences each week, so if Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, he earns 1000*5 = 5000 cents from Publisher A in one week.\nSince Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence, he earns 1000*10 = 10000 cents from Publisher B in one week.\nIn total, Mark makes 10000+5000 = 15000 cents in a week from both publishers.\nTherefore, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week from his work.\n#### 15000\n"}, {"text": "\nMark edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.\nSince Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark 5 cents * 2 = 10 cents per sentence.\nIn a week, Mark edits 500 * 5 = 2500 sentences for Publisher A.\nIn a week, Mark edits 500 * 10 = 5000 sentences for Publisher B.\nIn a week, Mark makes 5000 * 5 = 25000 cents from Publisher A.\nIn a week, Mark makes 25000 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24900 cents from Publisher B, 25000 cents - 1000 cents = 24900 cents.\nIn a week, Mark makes 24", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nMark is a copy-editor.
