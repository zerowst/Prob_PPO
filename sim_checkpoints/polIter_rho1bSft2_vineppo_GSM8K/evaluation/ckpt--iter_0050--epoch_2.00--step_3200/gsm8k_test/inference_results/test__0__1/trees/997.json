First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?\n\nSolution:\nWalter starts with $500 from his neighbors and adds $1500 from his online fund, 500 + 1500 = $2000.\nHis lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so his lawyer is going to donate 3 * 2000 = $6000.\nNow Walter has 2000 + 6000 = $8000, and he is going to tell his lawyer about this total.\nSince his lawyer is going to contribute as well, Walter's lawyer will also contribute to his total, so Walter's lawyer is going to contribute 8000, which is the final amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute.\n#### 8000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.012190237641335, "len_probs": 178, "answer": "\nWalter starts with $500 from his neighbors and adds $1500 from his online fund, 500 + 1500 = $2000.\nHis lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so his lawyer is going to donate 3 * 2000 = $6000.\nNow Walter has 2000 + 6000 = $8000, and he is going to tell his lawyer about this total.\nSince his lawyer is going to contribute as well, Walter's lawyer will also contribute to his total, so Walter's lawyer is going to contribute 8000, which is the final amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute.\n#### 8000\n"}]}
