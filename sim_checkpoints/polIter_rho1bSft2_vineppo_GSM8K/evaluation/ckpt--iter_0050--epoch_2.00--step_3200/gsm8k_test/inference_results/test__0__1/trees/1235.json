If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to convert Michael's average speed from km/hr to km/day. We know that there are 24 hours in a day, so we divide 50 by 24 to get 50/24 = 2.08 km/hr.\nNext, we multiply this by the number of days he's traveling to get the total distance covered in km. Michael is traveling for 3 days, so we multiply 2.08 km/hr * 3 days = 6.24 km.\nNow we need to find out what percentage of the total distance this is. We can do this by dividing the distance covered by the total distance and then multiplying by 100%. So we divide 6.24 km / 6000 km * 100% = 10.4%.\nTherefore, Michael has covered 10.4% of the total distance.\n#### 10.4\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.161720145493746, "len_probs": 215, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to convert Michael's average speed from km/hr to km/day.
