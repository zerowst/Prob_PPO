weeks\nTherefore, Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks * (number of weeks Sandy takes to lose weight / 4 weeks) weeks = 4 weeks * (number of weeks Sandy takes to lose weight / 4 weeks) weeks\nTherefore, Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks * (number of weeks Sandy takes to lose weight / 4 weeks) weeks = 4 weeks * (number of weeks Sandy takes to lose weight / 4 weeks) weeks\nTherefore, Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks * (number of weeks Sandy takes to lose weight / 4 weeks) weeks = 4 weeks * (number of
