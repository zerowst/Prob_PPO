He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?\n\nSolution:\nElliott took half of his 10,000 steps, which is 1/2 * 10,000 = 5,000 steps.\nHe took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, so he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\nHe also went for a short jog around the block, so he took 2,000 steps.\nThus, in total Elliott took 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n#### 8,000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.143147729337215, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nElliott took half of his 10,000 steps, which is 1/2 * 10,000 = 5,000 steps.\nHe took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, so he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\nHe also went for a short jog around the block, so he took 2,000 steps.\nThus, in total Elliott took 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n#### 8,000\n"}, {"text": "\nElliott took half of his steps for a walk to and from school, which is 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.\nHe also took another 1,000 steps for a short walk with his friend.\nThis means Elliott took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\nAfter his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left, so he must have taken the remaining steps during his jog.\nTherefore Elliott took a total of 10,000 steps - 6,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 2,000 steps during his jog.\n#### 2,000\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.
