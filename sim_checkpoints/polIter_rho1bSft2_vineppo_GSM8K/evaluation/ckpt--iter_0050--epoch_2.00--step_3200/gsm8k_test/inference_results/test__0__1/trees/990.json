The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?\n\nSolution:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room up 4 * 2 = 8 degrees.\nSo the total effect of the air conditioner was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so it didn't do anything.\nThus the final temperature was 0 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so 0.\n#### 0\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.30876173079014, "len_probs": 109, "answer": "\nThe air conditioner cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\nThe air conditioner warmed the room up 4 * 2 = 8 degrees.\nSo the total effect of the air conditioner was 6 + 8 = 14 degrees.\nThe air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so it didn't do anything.\nThus the final temperature was 0 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so 0.\n#### 0\n"}]}
