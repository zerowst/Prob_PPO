The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the volume of the pool: 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.\nThen multiply that number by 5.9: 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 836\nMr. Smith needs to fill the pool, so he needs 836 gallons of water.\nThe cost to fill the pool is 836 gallons * $0.10 per gallon = $83.60.\nSo it will cost Mr. Smith $83.60 to fill his pool.\n#### 83.60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -14.077822923660278, "len_probs": 143, "answer": "\nFirst find the volume of the pool: 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.\nThen multiply that number by 5.9: 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 836\nMr. Smith needs to fill the pool, so he needs 836 gallons of water.\nThe cost to fill the pool is 836 gallons * $0.10 per gallon = $83.60.\nSo it will cost Mr. Smith $83.60 to fill his pool.\n#### 83.60\n"}]}
