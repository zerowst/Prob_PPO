He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?\n\nSolution:\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nHe rested for 12/2=6 hours\nThe total time for swimming was 6+1=7\nThe next part of the trip he went 12/2=6 miles\nHe went 6*0.5=3 miles per hour\nSo it took him 6+3=9 hours to finish the remaining distance\nThe total time was 7+9=16 hours\n#### 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -18.782157484441996, "len_probs": 108, "answer": "\nHe swam 20*.6=12 miles\nHe rested for 12/2=6 hours\nThe total time for swimming was 6+1=7\nThe next part of the trip he went 12/2=6 miles\nHe went 6*0.5=3 miles per hour\nSo it took him 6+3=9 hours to finish the remaining distance\nThe total time was 7+9=16 hours\n#### 16\n"}]}
