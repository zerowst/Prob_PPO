Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?\n\nSolution:\nJack is playing with 3 friends, so the total amount of people playing is 1+2+1 = 4 people.\nThey play for 4 hours, so the total amount of time they play is 4*60 = 240 minutes.\nEach person plays for 20*1/2 = 10 minutes, because they are half as long as Jack.\nEach person also plays for 10*1.5 = 15 minutes because they are 1.5 times as long as Jack.\nSo, in total, they all play 240/4 = 60 of Jack's games.\nTherefore, they use 60*20 = $1200.\n#### 1200\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.053525149822235, "len_probs": 168, "answer": "\nJack is playing with 3 friends, so the total amount of people playing is 1+2+1 = 4 people.\nThey play for 4 hours, so the total amount of time they play is 4*60 = 240 minutes.\nEach person plays for 20*1/2 = 10 minutes, because they are half as long as Jack.\nEach person also plays for 10*1.5 = 15 minutes because they are 1.5 times as long as Jack.\nSo, in total, they all play 240/4 = 60 of Jack's games.\nTherefore, they use 60*20 = $1200.\n#### 1200\n"}, {"text": "\nEach of Jack's friends can play for 20*(1/2)=10 minutes\nThey play for a total of 10*2=20 minutes per friend\nThey play for a total of 20*2=40 minutes\nThey play for a total of 4*60=240 minutes\nThey play for a total of 4 hours so that's 4*60=240 minutes\nThey used 240/240*3=3*60=180 dollars in gaming\n#### 180\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.
