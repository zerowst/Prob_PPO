Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?\n\nSolution:\nJon's time was 40 minutes for swimming + 1 hour 20 minutes for cycling + 50 minutes for running = 90 minutes.\nJames was 10% faster at the swim, so he finished in 10% less time, so his time was 90 - (10% of 90) = 90 - 9 = 81 minutes.\nHe took 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his time for the bike was 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 1 hour 25 minutes.\nSo James's total time was 81 minutes for swimming + 1 hour 25 minutes for cycling = 96 minutes.\nThus James's time for the run was 96 minutes - 10 minutes he was ahead = 86 minutes.\n#### 86\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -24.26977651938796, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nJon's time was 40 minutes for swimming + 1 hour 20 minutes for cycling + 50 minutes for running = 90 minutes.\nJames was 10% faster at the swim, so he finished in 10% less time, so his time was 90 - (10% of 90) = 90 - 9 = 81 minutes.\nHe took 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his time for the bike was 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 1 hour 25 minutes.\nSo James's total time was 81 minutes for swimming + 1 hour 25 minutes for cycling = 96 minutes.\nThus James's time for the run was 96 minutes - 10 minutes he was ahead = 86 minutes.\n#### 86\n"}, {"text": "\nThe total time for the run is 50 minutes + 50 minutes = 100 minutes.\nIf it takes James 10% less time to complete the run, then it takes him 100 minutes - (100 minutes * 0.1) = 90 minutes.\nJames finishes the run 10 minutes faster than Jon, who took 100 minutes, so he took 100 - 10 = 90 minutes.\nJames took 90 - 5 = 85 minutes to complete the run.\n#### 85\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nJon runs a triathlon.
