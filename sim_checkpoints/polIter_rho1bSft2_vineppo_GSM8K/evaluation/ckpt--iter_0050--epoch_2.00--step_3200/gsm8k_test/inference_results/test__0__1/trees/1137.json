He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?\n\nSolution:\nAfter pouring the water, Donny's water bottle has 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, for a total of 4+1=5 ounces.\nSince Donny can only drink water at least 40 degrees, he can drink the 5 ounces of water in his water bottle.\nThis means that 5 ounces of water is equal to 5 ounces, and therefore he can drink the water at the second bottle's temperature.\nSince the second bottle's temperature is unknown, it could be any temperature less than 40 degrees.\n#### 40\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -27.030718829482794, "len_probs": 149, "answer": "\nAfter pouring the water, Donny's water bottle has 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, for a total of 4+1=5 ounces.\nSince Donny can only drink water at least 40 degrees, he can drink the 5 ounces of water in his water bottle.\nThis means that 5 ounces of water is equal to 5 ounces, and therefore he can drink the water at the second bottle's temperature.\nSince the second bottle's temperature is unknown, it could be any temperature less than 40 degrees.\n#### 40\n"}, {"text": "\nHe poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, which is 4*33=132 degrees.\nHe was able to drink the water after pouring 132 degrees from the first bottle into his water bottle, which is 132+4=136 degrees.\nSince he poured 1 ounce from the other bottle, which is 1*x=x, the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees.\nThe second bottle was at least 40-x degrees.\nSo he could drink the water from the second bottle is 40-x>136\nSo the answer is 136<40-x\nx<86\nThe second bottle was at least 40-86= -46 degrees.
