There are 18 large jellyfish + the rest that are small = 18 + (the number of small jellyfish)\nThere are 6 small jellyfish that didn't change color, so the total number of jellyfish is 18 + 6 = 24 jellyfish.\n#### 24\n"}, {"text": "\nThere were 6 large jellyfish because 6 / (1/3) = 6\nThere were 20 jellyfish before the light turned on because 6 / (1/5) = 20\nThere were 40 jellyfish in the tank before because 20 + 6 = 26\nThere were 100 jellyfish in the tank after because 26 x 5 = 130\n#### 130\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it.
