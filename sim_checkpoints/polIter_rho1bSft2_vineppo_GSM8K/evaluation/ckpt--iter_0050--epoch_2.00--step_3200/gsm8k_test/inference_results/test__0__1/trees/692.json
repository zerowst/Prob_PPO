What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?\n\nSolution:\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.\nAll the fruits in a crate are sold for a total price, so the price of a crate is: 5 * $0.5 + 12 * $1 + 7 * $3 = $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\nThe price for such a crate of fruit is $38.\n#### 38\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -13.955138742923737, "len_probs": 141, "answer": "\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.\nAll the fruits in a crate are sold for a total price, so the price of a crate is: 5 * $0.5 + 12 * $1 + 7 * $3 = $5 + $12 + $21 = $38.\nThe price for such a crate of fruit is $38.\n#### 38\n"}, {"text": "\nOne apple costs $0.5.\nOne banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs 0.5 * 2 = $1.\nOranges are the most expensive, so one orange costs 3 * 1 = $3.\nThe price of a crate of fruit consists of the prices of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.\nSo the total price would be 5 * 1 + 12 * 1 + 7 * 3 = $5 + 12 + 21 = $38.\nSo the price for such a crate of fruit would be $38.\n#### 38\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit.
