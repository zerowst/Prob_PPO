If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the total number of miles Grandma walks on the beach: 40 minutes * (1 mile / 2 miles) = 20 miles\nThen find the total number of miles Grandma walks in the entire trail: 2 miles + 20 miles = 22 miles\nThen subtract the number of miles she spends walking on the beach from the total to find how many miles she walks on the sidewalk: 3 miles - 2 miles = 1 mile\nThen multiply that number by the rate of speed on the sidewalk to find how long she spends walking there: 1 mile * (speed on sidewalk / 2) = (speed on sidewalk / 2) * 1\nThen add that amount of time to the time spent walking on the beach to find the total time spent walking: (speed on sidewalk / 2) * 1 + 40 minutes = (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1)\nThen multiply the time spent walking on the sidewalk by the number of miles that portion of the trail consists of to find the total time spent on that portion of the trail: (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 mile / 2 miles) = (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2)\nThen add that amount of time to the time spent walking on the beach to find the total time spent walking: (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) + 40 minutes\nThen add the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk to find the total time spent walking: (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) + 40 + 20 = (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) + 60\nThen add the time spent walking on the beach to the time spent walking on the sidewalk to find the total time spent walking: (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) + 60 + 40 = (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) + 100\nThen multiply the speed on the sidewalk by (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) to find the speed on the sidewalk in miles per minute: (speed on sidewalk / 2) * (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) = (speed on sidewalk * 40 + speed on sidewalk * 1) / 4\nThen multiply the speed on the sidewalk by (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) to find the speed on the sidewalk in miles per minute: (speed on sidewalk * 40 + speed on sidewalk * 1) / 4 = (speed on sidewalk * 41) / 4\nThen multiply the speed on the sidewalk by (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) to find the speed on the sidewalk in miles per minute: (speed on sidewalk * 41) / 4 = 100\nThen multiply the speed on the sidewalk by (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) to find the speed on the sidewalk in miles per minute: (speed on sidewalk * 41) / 4 = 100\nThen multiply the speed on the sidewalk by (40 + 1) * (1 / 2) to find the speed on the sidewalk in miles per minute: (speed on sidewalk * 41) / 4 = 100\nThen add the speed on the sidewalk to find the speed for the entire trail: 100 + 100 = 200 miles per hour\nThen divide the total distance of the trail by the speed on the sidewalk to find the time it takes to walk the entire trail: 3 miles / 200 miles per hour = 0.015 hours\nThen divide the time in hours by 60 to convert it to minutes: 0.015 hours * 60 minutes / 1 hour = 0.9 minutes\n#### 0.9\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -57.76642243564129, "len_probs": 978, "answer": "\nFirst find the total number of miles Grandma walks on the beach: 40 minutes * (1 mile / 2 miles) = 20 miles\nThen find the total number of miles Grandma walks in the entire trail: 2 miles + 20 miles = 22 miles\nThen subtract the number of miles she spends walking on the beach from the total to find how many miles she walks on the sidewalk: 3 miles -
