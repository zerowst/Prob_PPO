If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are left until Andy's birthday. Since December 31st is the end of the current year and July 19th is the end of Andy's goal, we subtract the number of days between these two dates: 31 days - 19 days = 12 days.\nNext, we divide the number of days left until Andy's birthday by the number of days in a year to find the number of calories he needs to burn each day: 12 days / 365 days/year = 0.035 calories/day.\nFinally, we subtract this number from 3500 calories to find the net calories Andy needs to burn each day to reach his goal: 3500 calories - 0.035 calories/day * 3500 calories = 30,000 calories.\nTherefore, Andy needs to burn 30,000 calories / 12 days = 2500 calories/day to reach his goal.\n#### 2500\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -25.28398986160755, "len_probs": 251, "answer": "\nFirst, we need to determine how many days are left until Andy's birthday.
