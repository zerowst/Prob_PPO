On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?\n\nSolution:\nOn Monday night, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday night, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nOn Wednesday night, he completed 1/4 of the remaining problems. If there were 100 problems in total, he completed 1/4 * 100 - 100 - 36 problems on Wednesday night.\nThus, on Thursday night, Chris completed 100 - 12 - 36 - (1/4 * 100 - 100 - 36) problems.\nTherefore, on Thursday night, Chris had 100 - 12 - 36 - (1/4 * 100 - 100 - 36) = 100 - 36 - (1/4 * 100 - 100 - 36) problems left.\nSo, Chris has 100 - 36 - (1/4 * 100 - 100 - 36) = 100 - 36 - (1/4 * 100) + 36 = 100 - 36 - 25 + 36 = 60 problems.\n#### 60\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -30.996958009898663, "len_probs": 313, "answer": "\nOn Monday night, Chris completed 12 problems.\nOn Tuesday night, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.\nOn Wednesday night, he completed 1/4 of the remaining problems.
