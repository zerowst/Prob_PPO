How many points does Amy score if there are 10 multiple-choice questions, 20 true/false questions, and 5 long answer questions?\n\nSolution:\nAmy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.\nAmy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.\nAmy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.\nIn total, Amy answers 8 + 18 + 3 = 31 questions correctly.\nTherefore, Amy's score is 31 * (1 point each for multiple-choice questions) + 18 * (1 point each for true/false questions) + 3 * (5 points each for long answer questions) = 31 + 18 + 15 = 64.\n#### 64\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -8.489599138498306, "len_probs": 203, "answer": "\nAmy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.\nAmy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.\nAmy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.\nIn total, Amy answers 8 + 18 + 3 = 31 questions correctly.\nTherefore, Amy's score is 31 * (1 point each for multiple-choice questions) + 18 * (1 point each for true/false questions) + 3 * (5 points each for long answer questions) = 31 + 18 + 15 = 64.\n#### 64\n"}, {"text": "\nAmy gets 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions correct, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 correct.\nAmy gets 90% of the 20 true/false questions correct, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 correct.\nAmy gets 60% of the 5 long answer questions correct, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 correct.\nIn total, Amy scores 8 + 18 + 3 = 31 points from the multiple-choice and true/false questions.\nIn total, she scores 5 * 5 = 25 points from the long answer questions.\nSo in all, Amy scores 31 + 25 = 56 points from her work on the test.\n#### 56\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nAmy is taking a history test.
