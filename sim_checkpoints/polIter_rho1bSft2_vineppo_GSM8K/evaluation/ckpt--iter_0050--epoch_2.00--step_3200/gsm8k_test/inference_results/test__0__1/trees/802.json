If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?\n\nSolution:\nBubbles currently has 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 15 stuffed animals.\nIf she wants 30% of her total stuffed animals to be stuffed goats, she needs to have 0.30 * total stuffed animals = 0.30 * (total stuffed animals)\nThis means the total number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 0.30 * (total stuffed animals) = 0.30 * (15 + x)\nThis is where the x comes from. The total number of stuffed goats is 0.30 * (15 + x)\nSo the answer is x = 15 + 0.30 * (x)\nx = 15 + 0.30x\n0.70x = 15\nx = 15 / 0.70\nx = 21.43\nShe needs to buy 21 more stuffed goats.\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -22.67545846104622, "len_probs": 248, "answer": "\nBubbles currently has 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 15 stuffed animals.\nIf she wants 30% of her total stuffed animals to be stuffed goats, she needs to have 0.30 * total stuffed animals = 0.30 * (total stuffed animals)\nThis means the total number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 0.30 * (total stuffed animals) = 0.30 * (15 + x)\nThis is where the x comes from.
