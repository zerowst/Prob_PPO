Then George ate 5 candies. Now George has 3 candies left. How many candies does Nick have?\n\nSolution:\nAfter George ate 5 candies, he had 3 candies left means before he ate 3+5 = 8 candies.\nSo Nick had twice as many candies as George before George ate 5, which means Nick had 2*8 = 16 candies before George ate them.\nNow there are 16 candies left after Nick had his share. This means Nick had 16 candies before Nick had his share, which means Nick has 16 candies.\nSo the answer is 16.\n#### 16\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.074280843138695, "len_probs": 127, "answer": "\nAfter George ate 5 candies, he had 3 candies left means before he ate 3+5 = 8 candies.\nSo Nick had twice as many candies as George before George ate 5, which means Nick had 2*8 = 16 candies before George ate them.\nNow there are 16 candies left after Nick had his share.
