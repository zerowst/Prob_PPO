There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?\n\nSolution:\nFirst find the chance Marcus gets an extension from the teacher: 40% * 20% = 8%\nThen find the chance Marcus gets an extension from the whole class: 20% * 50% = 10%\nThen add those two probabilities to find the total chance of Marcus getting an extension: 8% + 10% = 18%\nThen subtract the chance Marcus gets an extension from the normal teacher: 100% - 18% = 82%\nThen multiply that chance by the chance the normal teacher comes in to find the chance Marcus gets his homework: 82% * 50% = 41%\nThen multiply that chance by the chance the normal teacher doesn't give an extension to find the chance Marcus gets his homework: 41% * 50% = 20.5%\nThen multiply that chance by the chance Marcus gets an extension from the whole class to find the chance he has to turn in his homework: 20.5% * 50% = 10.25%\nThen add that chance to the chance Marcus gets an extension from the normal teacher to find the total chance Marcus has to turn in his homework: 10.25% + 41% = 51.25%\n#### 51.25\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -20.219498813152313, "len_probs": 302, "answer": "\nFirst find the chance Marcus gets an extension from the teacher: 40% * 20% = 8%\nThen find the chance Marcus gets an extension from the whole class: 20% * 50% = 10%\nThen add those two probabilities to find the total chance of Marcus getting an extension: 8% + 10% = 18%\nThen subtract the chance Marcus gets an extension from the normal teacher: 100% - 18% = 82%\nThen multiply that chance by the chance the normal teacher comes in to find the chance Marcus gets his homework: 82% * 50% = 41%\nThen multiply that chance by the chance the normal teacher doesn't give an extension to find the chance Marcus gets his homework: 41% * 50% = 20.5%\nThen multiply that chance by the chance Marcus gets an extension from the whole class to find the chance he has to turn in his homework: 20.5% * 50% = 10.25%\nThen add that chance to the chance Marcus gets an extension from the normal teacher to find the total chance Marcus has to turn in his homework: 10.25% + 41% = 51.25%\n#### 51.25\n"}]}
