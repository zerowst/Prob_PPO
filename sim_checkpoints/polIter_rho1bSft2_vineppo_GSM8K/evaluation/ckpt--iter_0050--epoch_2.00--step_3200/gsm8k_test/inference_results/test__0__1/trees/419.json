Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?\n\nSolution:\nStanley's comb was 4,000 feet below the mountain's peak, and Stanley was 10,000 feet tall. That means Oliver was 10,000-4,000 = 6,000 feet tall.\nSince Oliver is climbing down, we need to subtract his height from the total distance he needs to climb.\nThat means Oliver needs to climb 6,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.\n#### 6000\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -17.384289234876633, "len_probs": 117, "answer": "\nStanley's comb was 4,000 feet below the mountain's peak, and Stanley was 10,000 feet tall.
