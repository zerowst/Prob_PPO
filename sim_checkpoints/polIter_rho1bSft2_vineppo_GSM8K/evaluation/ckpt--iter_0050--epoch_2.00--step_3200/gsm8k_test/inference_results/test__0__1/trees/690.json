Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. How many coins are they having ten years after they started their savings?\n\nSolution:\nRong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, which is 10*12 = 120 months.\nIf Rong saves 20 coins per month, his total savings after 120 months is 120*20 = 2400.\nNeil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, meaning he was saving at a rate of 2/5*20 = 8 more coins per month.\nIn total, Neil was saving an additional 8*12 = 96 coins per month.\nIf he was saving 8 more coins per month, and Rong was saving 20 coins per month, then together they were saving 8+20 = 28 coins per month.\nIf they were saving 28 coins per month for ten years, their total savings would be 28*10 = 280.\nAfter ten years, Rong has 2400 dollars, and Neil has 280 dollars in savings.\nTogether, they have 2400+280 = 2680 dollars after ten years.\n#### 2680\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -31.22689399495721, "len_probs": 284, "answer": "\nRong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, which is 10*12 = 120 months.\nIf Rong saves 20 coins per month, his total savings after 120 months is 120*20 = 2400.\nNeil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, meaning he was saving at a rate of 2/5*20 = 8 more coins per month.\nIn total, Neil was saving an additional 8*12 = 96 coins per month.\nIf he was saving 8 more coins per month, and Rong was saving 20 coins per month, then together they were saving 8+20 = 28 coins per month.\nIf they were saving 28 coins per month for ten years, their total savings would be 28*10 = 280.\nAfter ten years, Rong has 2400 dollars, and Neil has 280 dollars in savings.\nTogether, they have 2400+280 = 2680 dollars after ten years.\n#### 2680\n"}]}
