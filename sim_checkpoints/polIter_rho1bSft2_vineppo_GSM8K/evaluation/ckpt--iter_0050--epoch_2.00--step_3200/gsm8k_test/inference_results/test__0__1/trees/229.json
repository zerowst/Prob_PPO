How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?\n\nSolution:\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.3 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready, 84 x 3/4 = 63 were ready.\nThere were 84 - 63 = 21 that were not ready after two weeks.\nThere were 120 - 36 - 63 = 21 melons not ready after two weeks.\nTherefore 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\n#### 21\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -16.06654005125165, "len_probs": 161, "answer": "\nAfter two months, 120 x 0.3 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.\nAfter Ashlyn went home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\nAfter 3/4 of the melons were ready, 84 x 3/4 = 63 were ready.\nThere were 84 - 63 = 21 that were not ready after two weeks.\nThere were 120 - 36 - 63 = 21 melons not ready after two weeks.\nTherefore 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.\n#### 21\n"}, {"text": "\nAshlyn took home 120 x 0.30 = 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.\nThere were 120-36 = 84 baby watermelons that were not ready after two months.\nThree-fourths of the remaining melons, 84 x (3/4) = 63 baby watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.\nThere were 84-63 = 21 baby watermelons that were not ready after two months.\nThere were 21 baby watermelons that were not ready after two months.\nSo the answer is 21.\n#### 21\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
