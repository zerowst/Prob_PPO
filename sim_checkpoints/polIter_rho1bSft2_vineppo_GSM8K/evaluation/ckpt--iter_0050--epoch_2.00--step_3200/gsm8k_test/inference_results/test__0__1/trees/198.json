After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?\n\nSolution:\nIn the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.\nAfter a month, she collected 20 fewer cards, which means she had 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\nIn the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards, so she had 40 - 20 = 20 cards.\nIn the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first two months, which is 2 * (60 + 20) = 2 * 80 = 160 cards.\nAdding all the cards together, Elaine has 20 + 40 + 20 + 160 = 220 cards.\nTherefore, Elaine has 220 cards in total.\n#### 220\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -21.150627098977566, "len_probs": 200, "answer": "\nIn the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.\nAfter a month, she collected 20 fewer cards, which means she had 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\nIn the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards, so she had 40 - 20 = 20 cards.\nIn the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first two months, which is 2 * (60 + 20) = 2 * 80 = 160 cards.\nAdding all the cards together, Elaine has 20 + 40 + 20 + 160 = 220 cards.\nTherefore, Elaine has 220 cards in total.\n#### 220\n"}]}
