The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?\n\nSolution:\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece on Monday, which is 0.45*5 = 2.25 inches.\nSince the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. So he recycled the chalk on Monday after using it for 2.25 inches, which is 2.25 inches / 2 inches = 1.125 inches.\nThis means he had to recycle the chalk 1 time, so he had 5-1.125 = 3.875 inches left on Monday.\nHe used up 20% of the chalk on Monday, so he had 3.875 * 0.2 = 0.775 inches of chalk left after he had written with 20% of it.\nHe had 5-0.775 = 4.225 inches of chalk left after he had written with 20% of it on Monday.\nHe can use 20% of the chalk again on Tuesday, so he can use it until he has 4.225 * 0.2 = 0.845 inches of chalk left.\nTherefore, he has to use it on Tuesday after he had written with 20% of it, so he had to recycle the chalk 1 time on Tuesday.\nThis means he had to recycle the chalk 1 time in 2 days.\n#### 2\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -42.315253891050816, "len_probs": 356, "answer": "\nThe teacher used 45% of a 5-inch chalkboard piece on Monday, which is 0.45*5 = 2.25 inches.\nSince the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
