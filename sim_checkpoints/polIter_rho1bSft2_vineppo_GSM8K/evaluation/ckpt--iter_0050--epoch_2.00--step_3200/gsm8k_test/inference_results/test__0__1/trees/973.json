This can be written as: y = (1/2)*x + 4\nWe are asked to find the total number of states in both countries together. This is represented by the sum of the variables 'x' and 'y'. This can be written as: x + y\nWe now have two equations that represent the total number of states in both countries together. We can solve for 'x' and 'y' by substituting the expression for 'y' from the first equation into the second equation.\nThis gives: x + (1/2)*x + 4 = total number of states in both countries together\nMultiplying through the parentheses gives: (3/2)*x + 4 = total number of states in both countries together\nSubtracting 4 from both sides gives: (3/2)*x = total number of states in both countries together - 4\nMultiplying through the parentheses gives: x = (total number of states in both countries together - 4)*(3/2)\nThis gives the total number of states in both countries together as: x + y = (total number of states in both countries together - 4)*(3/2)\nThis is the total number of states in both countries together.\nThe total number of states in both countries together is 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*x - 4\n#### 3/2*x\n#### 3/2*"}]}
