The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?\n\nSolution:\nThe collar takes 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes 90 stitches x 2 = 180 stitches.\nSo the body of the sweater and the collar is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1,180 stitches.\nThus, the sleeves take 1,800 - 1,180 = 620 stitches.\nEach sleeve therefore takes 620 / 2 = 310 stitches.\n#### 310\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -15.086134664714336, "len_probs": 147, "answer": "\nThe collar takes 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes 90 stitches x 2 = 180 stitches.\nSo the body of the sweater and the collar is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1,180 stitches.\nThus, the sleeves take 1,800 - 1,180 = 620 stitches.\nEach sleeve therefore takes 620 / 2 = 310 stitches.\n#### 310\n"}, {"text": "\nThe body of the sweater takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches per sleeve.\nThe rosette takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches per sleeve.\nThere are 1800 - 900 - 180 = 620 stitches that are not sleeves.\nThus, there are 620 / 2 = 310 stitches per sleeve.\nThere are 2 * 310 = 620 stitches for the sleeves.\nThus there are 900 - 620 = 280 stitches left for the sleeves.\nTherefore, there are 280 / 2 = 140 stitches per sleeve.\n#### 140\n", "depth": 1, "full_text": "[MATH_TASK] Problem:\nTerri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette.
