She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?\n\nSolution:\nMillie makes 4 * $1 = $4 in revenue per hour that she sells lemonade.\nTherefore, Millie's profit per hour is $4 - the cost of supplies = $4 - $18 = -$14\nSince the result is negative, Millie's profit is actually $14 less than her expenses, so she makes a profit of $14 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.\n#### 14\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -23.060175977647305, "len_probs": 108, "answer": "\nMillie makes 4 * $1 = $4 in revenue per hour that she sells lemonade.\nTherefore, Millie's profit per hour is $4 - the cost of supplies = $4 - $18 = -$14\nSince the result is negative, Millie's profit is actually $14 less than her expenses, so she makes a profit of $14 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.\n#### 14\n"}]}
