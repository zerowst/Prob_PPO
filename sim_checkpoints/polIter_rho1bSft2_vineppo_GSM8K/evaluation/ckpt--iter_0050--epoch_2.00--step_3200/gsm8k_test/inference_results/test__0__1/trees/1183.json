How many apples did he bring home?\n\nSolution:\nAfter Newton picked up the two apples he put one in his pocket, there were 2 apples in the tree, and then 5 more fell, making 7 total.\nThen he picked up the remaining apple, and the tree fell another 6 apples, making 13 total.\nHe had 13 apples in his pocket, and then he picked up the last apple, so he brought home 13 apples.\n#### 13\n", "stop_text": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "cot_probs": -19.285123609006405, "len_probs": 101, "answer": "\nAfter Newton picked up the two apples he put one in his pocket, there were 2 apples in the tree, and then 5 more fell, making 7 total.\nThen he picked up the remaining apple, and the tree fell another 6 apples, making 13 total.\nHe had 13 apples in his pocket, and then he picked up the last apple, so he brought home 13 apples.\n#### 13\n"}, {"text": "\nNewton picked up two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
